From Dirang, we started our return journey. Wife was keen to contiue till Tawang, but Dirang to Tawang is 175km, and journey takes 8 to 10 hours, as bad roads. We were not keen to do this hectic leg with kids in tow. So, we decided to head back towards Assam.

## Day4 : Dirang -> Nameri National Park

If you recall pics from Day2, we stopped at Nameri EcoPark for lunch. It was a lovely place, in middle of jungle. So this is where we decided to head back. 

## Day5: Nameri -> Kajiranga

## Day6 : Kajiranga

## Day7 : Kaziranga -> Majuli

For Day1, our target was to reach at Bhalukpong, which is end point of Assam. We started around 8AM from hotel. All excited, trip was starting now. Some pics from Day2:

For lunch, we stopped at a place called Nameri Fishing Camp. This was a beautiful place, in middle of jungle. Unfortunately, food was finished there!

## Day3 - Bhalukpong -> Dirang (110km)
TBD
After having a nice breakfast at the lodge, we left for Dirang. The roads starts to go little bad from Bhalukpong, and it was expected to take about 4-5 hours to reach. 
Bhalukpong is one of the entry point for Arunachal Pradesh. So we had to show our ILP here.   
Weather was very nice today, and scenery even more so.

There was a "famous" hot water spring in Dirang. We climbed down there. What a disappointment it was. Having seen hot water geysers in Ladakh, we were expecting something similar. But water was not even lukewarm. Some locals were bathing in there, and it all looked very unhygenic. Surely a waste of time.

There are many solar panels all around North East. It is subsidized by government. A good initiative.
