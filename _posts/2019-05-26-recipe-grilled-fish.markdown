Fish is an excellant food - full of Protein, Omega 3 and essential vitamins and minerals. I love to grill fish - it is healthiest form of consuming fish

## Ingredients: 

* Basa Fish Fillets - 1kg (I prefer Basa as it is boneless and easily available)
* Ghee - 2 spoons
* Black Salt - 1/4 tbsp
* Pepper - 1/4 tbsp
* Lemon - 1

* serving size: 2-3 person
    
## Directions:

1. Bring Fish to Room Temperature. If in hurry, defrost setting of microwave can be used. 

2. Mix Ghee + Black Salt + Pepper in a bowl.

3. Using Lemon, apply the above mix on the fish generously. 

4. Put in a glass / microwave safe plate and put in microwave.

5. In Microwave, Using Grill + Microwave Combo. Almost all microwave have it. I use Combo 2 - 50% Microwave power, 50% Grill. Start timer of 8 min.

6. After 8 min is over, take fish out. Apply the mix again to moisture the fish. Turn side, and start timer for another 8min.

7. Once done, now use the microwave setting, and let it for 5 min.

8. Serve and Enjoy
     
## Notes:
Take care to apply ghee properly on the fish sides too. That is an area which usually gets missed out.
