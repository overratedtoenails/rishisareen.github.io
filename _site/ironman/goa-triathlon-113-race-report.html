<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Triathlon. Goa. Jan weather. On discovering this race, I signed up immediately.<br />
This would be awesome way to start 2019. Or so I thought!</p>

<p>Few days before the race, I had a small fishing accident where my right knee banged against the rock. 
In next days, the pain got bearable, and I continued my training. I could not afford to skip training. Past 4 weeks had gone by with no training.</p>

<p>But even after 5 days of accident, the pain was not going away. On my coach’s suggestion, I went to see an Ortho doc.</p>

<p>Doc did an X-Ray, which revealed a hairline fracture. Doctor <em>adviced</em> bedrest for 3 weeks. Now, from injury to x-ray, I had already done a few training sessions - swim, bike and run. So I knew it was not that bad, but close monitoring was needed. Kaustubh (my coach) asked me to rest and recover, with no workout till event date.</p>

<p>I also considered dropping from the event. But as all expenses (Event Fee, Hotel, Flight)  were already paid, I decided to still go ahead. If nothing else, I would at least get another open waters swim experience.</p>

<h2 id="pre-race">Pre Race</h2>
<p>I reached Goa 2 days before the race. Coming from Cold Delhi winters to tropical Goa - it was a big and sudden change in the weather.
Saturday was spent in getting a small practice swim in the sea (scary, 3rd open water swim experience), followed by bike route recee.</p>

<p>This time I chose not to take my cycle, but rent locally. Another experiment.</p>

<p>Sat evening was spent organizing my race kit. Took an early dinner, and tried (unsuccessfully) to sleep.</p>

<p>Event start time was 8am. I got up at 5:15 am, got ready, and had a light breakfast of omelet and coffee. I always take a light breakfast before the event, it gives stomach some nutrition too, and time to settle down.</p>

<p>Reaching the venue, I went directly to the transition area and arranged the stuff as per transition’s order.There was nice cold breeze. But I knew temperature and humidity will rise sharply soon.</p>

<h2 id="race-strategy">Race Strategy</h2>
<p>As I was still nursing an injured knee, race strategy was very conservative - complete swim, try to complete bike, and do not run. The strategy was based on the comparative impact on the knee - swim is easy on the knee, cycling manageable, and run is most brutal on the knee.</p>

<h2 id="swim-19km---59min">Swim [1.9km - 59min]</h2>
<p>Sharp at 7:50am, organizers asked us to assemble near swim start point. I did walking meditation, which helped me to be in a calm mindset and not think of sea panic. There were warnings of jellyfishes. On local friends advice, we had applied Vaseline on the body. It apparently reduces the jellyfish sting.</p>

<p>Swim was a single loop - go straight 900m, turn left and go 100m, come back for 900m.</p>

<p>At 8:05, flag off was done, we ran towards the sea.
It started smooth. I slowly got into the rhythm, gradually built pace and quickly covered 500m. Suddenly I felt a sharp sting on my left arm. Ah, I was greeted by jellyfish. It was a sharp sting, and pained for a few minutes. I slowed for a bit, but continued to swim.</p>

<p>Soon I sighted the first 900m buoy. It was closeby. At this part in sea, water suddenly got choppy. Organizers have warned about this stretch. I started to stroke hard to stay afloat. And that is when I got my second jellyfish sting, this time on the right hand. Ah, now this was getting filmy, and I felt like a hero being tested. I actually smiled at my drama loving mind, then moved my arms faster and managed to reach the buoy.</p>

<p>Taking left from the buoy, water became smoother. Soon I reached next buoy (100m away) and started the return leg. On the return part, there were no buoy to sight, and shore was too far off. I followed other athletes. And around here, the third jellyfish sting happened. Right wrist this time. This was getting too much to handle. Every time I would look downwards, jellyfishes were swimming. I tried to close my eyes when head in the water, and continued the return leg.<br />
Thankfully, I was spared from more attacks, and I soon finished the swim.</p>

<p>Later I checked - I ended up swimming 2200mts - full 300mts extra - because of jellyfish distraction and buoys so far off that sighting was a challenge. 300m of extra swim is easily 6-8min wasted!</p>

<h2 id="t1-7-min">T1 [7 min]</h2>
<p>Exiting the sea, I rushed to the medical tent. They were washing stings with vinegar. Lot of other athletes were in worse condition.<br />
I later discovered everyone got bit by jellyfish, and the average was 3 bites.</p>

<p>From medical tent, I ran to the transition area to fetch my cycle. As I was already wearing tri-suit, I just wore Heart Rate Monitor, sandals, helmet, gloves and off I went.</p>

<p>I took about 7” in this transition. This is terribly slow, but in my defense, I was busy cleaning off jellyfish stings.</p>

<h2 id="cycle-84km---322hours">Cycle [84km - 3:22hours]</h2>
<p>It had gotten hot by this time (9:10am). Immediately on the exit, there was a sharp incline for 0.6km. I walked a bit and then cycled on reaching the main road. I was constantly watching the knee pain.</p>

<p>Before the race, everyone was talking about an athlete Pablo. He was champion of Goa Triathlon for last 5 years and a strong contender for this year too. When I started my first loop, I saw Pablo zipping by. I was wondering was he on his 3rd loop or 4th?</p>

<p>On my 2nd loop, I met one participant - Rupesh. He was cycling at a speed similar to mine. I asked him some question about his bike, and then we started to cycle together. From there, till cycle end, we were together - talking about the race, college, and dunno what all stuff. It was his first triathlon, and that too a half iron distance. This sports do draw people with serious grit towards it.</p>

<p>Every loop, we took hydration breaks. Sun was getting stronger.<br />
Towards our 5th loop, we saw Pablo, who was now running. We wondered if we’ll finish our cycling or if he will finish his run first. 
Rupesh and I finished cycle around 12:30PM. Knee pain was  manageable. Kaustubh was also cheering and asking about my knee at every possible point.</p>

<h2 id="t2-9-min">T2 [9 min]</h2>
<p>Reaching T2, I again saw Pablo - smiling and relaxing. I understood he has finished his half iron. Damn, the dude was crazy fast.
Racking the cycle, I changed into running tee and lied down on grass for a couple of minutes to stretch the back. Rupesh was waiting, i asked him to continue ahead.</p>

<h2 id="run-221km---317hours">Run [22.1km - 3:17hours]</h2>
<p>Again that steep incline came. My plan was to walk for some time, and if knee is ok, then run. On reaching the top, knee was surprisingly good.</p>

<p>It was close to 1pm. The Sun was strong, no trees on the route, temperature was 35 deg. Savage!</p>

<p>I stopped at hydration station, got an ice bath. Having cold water on the body felt so good. I felt better, ran a bit faster, soon caught up with Rupesh. From here onwards, we stuck together for the next 16km.</p>

<p>We faced one more challenge - Ice was available only at the loop end. So 6km stretch with no ice or cold water in between! On every loop, I was doing this - get ice bath, put ice cubes in cap, run fast till body is cold (2km mostly), and then hang on till next ice stop. This continued till 17km, average a slow pace of 8kmph. Weather was absolutely insane by this time - as bad as my half iron experience in Thonnur.</p>

<p>When 17km mark was over, and knee still cooperating, I decided to finish strong. I went ahead from the pack.<br />
Last 5km came pace was 7:00, 7:39, 7:30, 7:37, 7:48. Not bad.</p>

<p>Last 600mts of downhill were done quickly, I saw the finish line. Kaustubh, as expected, was there - cheering and genuinely happy! I punched in the air, crossed the finish line.
Finally, 4th Half Ironman was done!</p>

<p>Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/2075345016</p>

<p>Overall time: 7hours 49 min.  This one was special - so much experience and mental victory of scary sea, and bad knee. So much learnings.</p>

<p>Next day, All Goa Newspapers covered about jellyfish infested sea and the event :). But I’m glad I did this race, fear of jellyfish is gone!
And Pablo got the timing of 4:20hrs. Yes, 4:20! In that heat!</p>
