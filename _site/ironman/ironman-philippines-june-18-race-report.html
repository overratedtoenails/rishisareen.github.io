<h3 id="race-strategy">Race Strategy</h3>
<p>This being my first Full Ironman, my race strategy was quite conservative.<br />
Ironman Philippines is a tough course (it won the award for Asia’s toughest ironman). We knew it would be hot and humid, with 2000m elevation in the bike leg<br />
Kaustubh (my coach) and I kept on exchanging message on the race and nutrition strategy<br />
He adviced me to monitor my nutrition very closely. <br />
Finishing the event was the biggest goal.</p>

<h3 id="swim-38km">Swim [3.8km]</h3>

<p>After all the panic that happened during the practice swim, actual race day swim left like anti-climax.</p>

<p>It was a rolling start swim, with a release of a group of 4 athletes for every 6 seconds
Pro Men started at 6:15am followed by Pro Females at 6:20am.<br />
For Age Groupers, we were divided in 5 Zones, based on our predicted swim timers. First timers were given a separate white cap so we could be spotted and monitored closely.</p>

<p>We slowly inched closer to the starting mat. I entered water around 6:40am.<br />
I was warned that swim start would be a chaos, and  it indeed was. There was so much shoving, kicking, jostling. After all 1000+ people were in a very compact area.<br />
I focused on couting my breath (Allan Pitman gave me this tip during a swim camp I attended). Counting distracts the mind from the chaos, and helps to settle down in a rhythm. This really helped.<br />
Soon I found a rhythm and started to draft off from one swimmer to another.<br />
First 1.9k was done in 52min.<br />
I entered water again, starting second loop. Second loop was much easier, and I managed to finish it in 50min. Right on the predicted timing.<br />

<p>Total Time: 1hr 42min

<h3 id="t1">T1</h3>
<p>This was a long transition - 1km from swim exit to cycle starting mat.<br />
The transition was well organized, no jostling or chaos. I quickly grabbed my bike, took a sip of water, wore helmet, gloves, glasses, sandals and walked towards the start mat.</p>

<p>Total Time: 10min</p>

<h3 id="cycle-180km">Cycle [180km]</h3>
<p>If I’ve to summarize cycling course of this Ironman in one word, it is “BRUTAL”.</p>

<p>The course starts easy, first 5km are flat and we move from the city to the expressway. <br />
But soon we faced the first climb - a grade of ~6% spread over 4km. There were also strong headwinds during that climb. I saw people getting off their TT bike and walk that section!</p>

<p>Post that climb, it was mostly rolling hills. I stopped at all hydration station, ensuring to re-fuel and get new water bottle. <br />
First u-turn was at km 50. Now the weather was getting hot. All athletes were taking ice baths at every nutrition stop.</p>

<p>Second U-Turn was at same  place - it was 130km done now. That is where weather took a bad turn. Heavy rain started, making roads very slippery. When the rain stopped, we were hit by strong headwinds. Next 20kms were sheer agony - body is tired, climbs are coming and headwind is relentless. Every pedal stroke was a struggle. I was not alone in this - everyone was slow and hanging on.</p>

<p>This was the time in the race when you enter a dark phase, you just want to stop for a while. I found few other athletes and started chatting with them to distract myself.</p>

<p>At around 160km, weather started to improve. Last 5km were all downhill, where I rode quickly.</p>

<p>I took almost 8 hours to finish cycling - slower by more than an hour from my worst margins. It was crazy. Thanks to long hours spent in the training, I could finish this.<br />

<p>Total Time: 7hr 50min</p>

<h3 id="t2-20min">T2 [20min]</h3>
<p>Towards the end of cycling, due to all ice water, heat and sweat, my bum had started to bleed (one boil erupted).<br />
Unfortunately, I was not carrying any cotton or band-aid. At T2 transition tent, I took towel and tried controlling the blood. Finally, after a very long 10min, blood flow stopped.<br />
I decided to change to running shorts for comfort. Shorts, Tee, Belt worn - I was off on the road again.<br />
Lesson Learnt - Keep basic first aid kit in Transition bag.</p>

<p>Total Time: 20min (Outrageous!)</p>

<h3 id="run-422km---557hours">Run [42.2km - 5:57hours]</h3>
<p>Running is weakest of my 3 sports. In the training, max run I had done was 25km in one go. So, my debut Ironman was also my debut marathon :-). Hey, I told you it is a crazy story.</p>

<p>It was 5pm when I started to run. I started slow - body was still stiff due to aero riding.</p>

<p>Similar to cycling, Run also had two loops. Only two half marathons to be done.</p>

<p>During the cycling leg, I was calculating race finish time. Original goal of sub 15 hours was long gone. So I had a new target - to get sub 16.<br />
This gave me about 7hours to finish the run. More than enough, as long as I don’t catch any injury.</p>

<p>After first 2km, body opened up a bit. First 10km came in 75min.<br />
<!-- _includes/image.html --></p>

  <p class="image-caption">500 600 Pain doesn't mean I won't pose </p>
</div>

<p>Then I met Vijay(his first ironman too), and we decided to run together. He was struggling a bit - pain in the knee. From Km 10 till Km 35, we ran and walked together, egging each other on.</p>

<p>When last 7km remained, I had 40min to get sub 16. This was a pace which I’ve not done even on fresh legs then - and this was after 15hours of fatigue. But I decided to go all out now.<br />
Those last 7km were so agonizing, but yet so beautiful. I constantly told my mind to shut up. During this last section, I overtook many people.<br />
As the finish line came closer, I could hear voice of Mike Reilly announcing finishers name. Last few minutes I picked up the pace further, finally sprinting at the red carpet. At the end of red carpet, I jumped and finished it strong.<br />

<p>End time: 15hours 57min.</p>

<p>Strava Link : None, Watch battery died.</p>

<p>Finally, Ironman was done! Exact 2 months before I turned 40.</p>

<h2 id="post-event">Post event</h2>
<p>Ironman Subic Bay was awarded as Asia’s <a href="http://www.asiatri.com/2018/12/2018-best-triathlon-races-in-asia/">toughest race course for 2018!</a>. To me, this would always remain most special race, the day I kicked off my bucket list in style, and never in those 16 hours, I had a thought to quit.</p>
