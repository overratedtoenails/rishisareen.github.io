The purpose of this yearly report is to reflect back on the last year, and to write an honest review of what went well, what could have gone better, and what I’m working towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing my annual Goal Setting and Review for 4 years now, and this is my first time doing a public annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 questions that I’m going to answer in my Annual Review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What went well this year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What didn’t go so well this year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What am I working toward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was an awesome year, with many achievements, but few stumbles too.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s get on with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-what-went-well-this-year&quot;&gt;1. What went well this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health/Sports:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a very good year in my Health and Sports pursuit. Major Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full Ironman (3.8km swim, 180k bike, 42.2km run) Completed successfully - Philippines, 3rd June&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/im70-dot-3-dit-2018-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Half Ironman&lt;/a&gt; done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Half Marathons completed, with Sub 2 timing achieved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportstimingsolutions.in/share/83F04C639426293CAF01.html&quot;&gt;1:59 Finish time&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m obviously very happy about these milestones. But even more than that, I’m happy that I was very consistent with my workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BsLFdUQgt48/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&quot;&gt;230 days and 432 hours of training&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Swim : 46h and 103.5km&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bike : 167h and 3931km&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Run : 169h and 1305km run.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strength and Flexibility Training: 49h&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 was the year where I learned swimming, 2018 was the year where I got decent in running. 2019 is the year of big gains in cycling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning New Stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; This year, most of my learning was done via Podcast medium. Though most of it was in the space of Triathlon (Science &amp;amp; Practical Training Ideas), there were other learning gems too - Tim Ferriss, Ben Greenfield Fitness, The Joe Rogan Experience. I even wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/podcasts/my-top-5-podcasts.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about my top podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt; Travel is both in “what went well”, and “need more”. After Ironman, I took few days off to roam in the Philippines, which was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Office:** Fantastic year, worked on a new product and new role and enjoyed engaging with different regional teams. It is so good when you’ve an awesome bunch of team members to work with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-what-didnt-go-so-well-this-year&quot;&gt;2. What didn’t go so well this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt; I really wanted to make Meditation as a regular habit in 2018. I did try multiple experiments, and even managed to do 200 sessions last year. But those were low-quality sessions, and Meditation as a habit is not yet formed. I have my takeaways on why it failed as habit Forming (no consistent timing of habit), and I’ll make myself better in this in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing:&lt;/strong&gt;  I want to be more regular in writing. Two main reasons - writing is a good way to clear the mind, and I also want to share my learnings with like-minded folks. I did not meet my the last year goals on Writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt; Can travel be enough? I guess not. I wanted to do a solo trek, and one with friends - didn’t yet happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-what-am-i-working-towards&quot;&gt;3. What am I working towards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit Forming:&lt;/strong&gt; If I’m obsessed with anything more than my sports, it is the superpower of Habits, and Science behind Habit forming. I’ve experimented on this a lot in last few years, and it will continue in 2019 too. Right habits are shortcuts to achieve other goals; will power is so overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports, particularly Triathlon, have been one of the changing moments of my life. By now, Sports is more or less an integral part of my life in a friction-free way. This year focus would be to continue to build on the gains, and do 2 Full Ironmans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Importance of Sleep is difficult to overstate. I’m not talking just about the number of hours, but the overall quality of sleep. This is an area I’ve stil not completely mastered, and experiements will continue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow More, Contribute More:&lt;/strong&gt; All my life, I’ve been obsessed with on consuming knowledge. Now I want to build things - via writing, building plans for friends for sports/health pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost all successful people rave about Meditation as one of their superpower. My experiments will continue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Writing:&lt;/strong&gt; Atleast one post a week, 52 posts a year. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue eliminate the non-essential:&lt;/strong&gt; To say yes to all the stuff, I’ve ruthlessly eliminate the inessential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is short, and not to be wasted randomly. I’m on the journey to explore, experiment, and discover more about myself in the process. There are so many areas of my life that can use some improvement. But the only way to influence future is do what I can do, now.&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers to a happy and progressive new year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They are similar to radio program, but they are audio files, and one can downlad and listen to them at their convenience. iOS and Android devices have podcast apps available for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For podcast listeners, podcasts are a way to enjoy great content from around the world for free. For podcast publishers, podcasts are a great way to reach a wide audience.
One can find podcasts for broad ranging topics - business, startup, sports, health, self-development, culture, history, …the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hooked on Podcasts for half a decade now. After books, this is my most preferred medium to acquire knowledge on any topic. 
I usually listen to podcast during my commute - 1:5 hours of total commute gives enough time to listen to one episode, and get some good knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of my top 5 favorite podcasts: 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/podcast/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tim Ferris Show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: For anyone who is into life hacking, Tim Ferriss is THE GURU. The Tim Ferriss Show is generally the #1 business podcast on all of Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the Tim’s description about his podcast:&lt;br /&gt;
 “Each episode, I deconstruct world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, sports, business, art, etc.) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use.  This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each episode varies from 45” to 2hours sometime. Tim is a master interviewer, and though interviews are of long duration, they are value for the time. I’ve listened to almost 200 podcasts from Tim, some of them multiple times. I can’t recommend this guy enough. If you listen to just one podcast, listen to Tim.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Particulary the episides with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Scott Adams, Tony Robbins, Peter Thiel were very good. I’ve learnt so many things from the guests on the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After listening to Terry Laughlin’s podcast on Tim’s Show, I implemented his techniques, and learnt swimming (&lt;strong&gt;at age 38!!!&lt;/strong&gt;). And that is just one example! Go, listen now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.joerogan.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; : Second to Tim, Joe is another master interviewer and does the long format interview. He was a standup comedian, MMA expert. His interview list is again wide ranging - comedians, actors, MMA fighters, authors and more. His interview with Wim Hoff and Sam Harris were particularly brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://purplepatchfitness.com/education/podcasts&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Patch Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This podcast is mostly geared towards triathlon, though his episodes on nutrition and hydration are useful to anyone who is active in sports. 
Matt Dixon has coached more podium finisher triathletes than any other coach. He has a no-nonsense, cut to the chase approach to the triathlon training. Each single episode is just outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Greenfield Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Ben Greenfield is the ultimate biohacker. His website says: “In 2013 and 2014, Ben was named as one of the world’s top 100 most influential people in health and fitness, and by 2015, Ben was coaching the world’s top CEO’s, chefs, biohackers, poker players, tennis, motocross and endurance competitors, and professional athletes from the UFC, the NHL, the NBA, the NFL and beyond – all while advising and investing in top companies in the health, fitness and nutrition industry.”. Ben is a treasure hove for anyone who wants to get a bit more fit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://primalendurance.libsyn.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primal Endurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This is hosted by Brad Kearns - another top former athlete. This podcast focus on healthy eating, rest, recovery. Most of my nutrition philosophy comes from Primal Endurance. Very logical, very strightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast world, just like the book world, is a very vast world. Internet has completely changed the content creation, and many leaders are using blogs and podcast method to reach out to audience and like minded people. The above list is from my favorite genre - Lifestyle management, and fitness. Hopefully this will give you some pointers to dip your toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read on : 2018-01-02&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rating : 7/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382&quot;&gt;Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg McKeown defines Essentialism as “Less but better”.  The key takeaway is that only once you give yourself the permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a well organized book, divided in four main parts. The first part establishes the need and mindset of an Essentialist. The second part delves into how to distinguish trivial from the essential. The third part then takes us through the strategies to cut out the trivial, and the final part discuss practical aspects on how to make the essential work an effortless work. The structure of the book is well thought of, and each part builds on the previous one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1--essence&quot;&gt;Part 1 : Essence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.” 
This part discuss about the need and mindset of an Essentialist, and why we need to pursue this.  Three main reasons why we need a disciplined and mindful pursuit of Essentialism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TOO MANY CHOICES. We have all observed the exponential increase in choices over the last decade. Yet even in the midst of it, and perhaps because of it, we have lost sight of the most important ones. As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.”
We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what isn’t. Psychologists call this “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TOO MUCH SOCIAL PRESSURE It is not just the number of choices that has increased exponentially, it is also the strength and number of outside influences on our decisions that has increased. While much has been said and written about how hyperconnected we now are and how distracting this information overload can be, the larger issue is how our connectedness has increased the strength of social pressure. Today, technology has lowered the barrier for others to share their opinion about what we should be focusing on. It is not just information overload; it is opinion overload.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THE IDEA THAT “YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL” The idea that we can have it all and do it all is not new. This myth has been peddled for so long, I believe virtually everyone alive today is infected with it. It is sold in advertising. It is championed in corporations. It is embedded in job descriptions that provide huge lists of required skills and experience as standard. It is embedded in university applications that require dozens of extracurricular activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an Australian nurse named Bronnie Ware, who cared for people in the last twelve weeks of their lives, recorded their most often discussed regrets. At the top of the list: &lt;strong&gt;“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”&lt;/strong&gt;
To harness the courage we need to get on the right path, it pays to reflect on how short life really is and what we want to accomplish in the little time we have left. As poet Mary Oliver wrote: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2--explore&quot;&gt;Part 2 : Explore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Explore, Greg delves into strategies on how to distinguish noise/non-essential from the essential. Main argument is we need to pause, allow ourselves some time to think and decide. React, not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Escape : In order to have focus we need to escape to focus. This is very true in corporate life too. Everyone is too busy to even pause and think on what is the strategic area. The speed at which we are running doesn’t matter much, if the direction is not correct. Still how many people dare to escape to focus on the essential.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look :- See what Matters :  In the chaos of the modern workplace, with so many loud voices all around us pulling us in many directions, it is more important now than ever that we learn to resist the siren song of distraction and keep our eyes and ears peeled for the headlines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play :  The value of play in our lives can’t be overstated. Studies from the animal kingdom reveal that play is so crucial to the development of key cognitive skills it may even play a role in a species’ survival. Bob Fagan, a researcher who has spent fifteen years studying the behavior of grizzly bears, discovered bears who played the most tended to survive the longest. When asked why, he said, “In a world continuously presenting unique challenges and ambiguity, play prepares these bears for a changing planet.  Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain. You know how it feels: you’re stressed about work and suddenly everything starts going wrong. You can’t find your keys, you bump into things more easily, you forget the critical report on the kitchen table. Recent findings suggest this is because stress increases the activity in the part of the brain that monitors emotions (the amygdala), while reducing the activity in the part responsible for cognitive function (the hippocampus)7—the result being, simply, that we really can’t think clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleep :  Protecting the Asset The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. One of the most common ways people—especially ambitious, successful people—damage this asset is through a lack of sleep. If we let our type A instincts take over, we will, like Geoff, be swallowed up whole. We will burn out too early. We need to be as strategic with ourselves as we are with our careers and our businesses. We need to pace ourselves, nurture ourselves, and give ourselves fuel to explore, thrive, and perform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select :  In a piece called “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,” the popular TED speaker Derek Sivers describes a simple technique for becoming more selective in the choices we make. The key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes, Derek-style. Anything less gets a thumbs down. If we search for “a good career opportunity,” our brain will serve up scores of pages to explore and work through. Instead, why not conduct an advanced search and ask three questions: “What am I deeply passionate about?” and “What taps my talent?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” Naturally there won’t be as many pages to view, but that is the point of the exercise. We aren’t looking for a plethora of good things to do. We are looking for the one where we can make our absolutely highest point of contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-3-eliminate&quot;&gt;Part 3: Eliminate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous parts author makes the case for why essentialism is needed, and how to identify what is essential and what is not. In this part, strategies on how to cut down on the non-essential. I particularly liked the emotional aspects of saying no, as we humans are hard-wired to strive in a society, and saying no is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the discipline to say no to opportunities—often very good opportunities—that come your way in work and life is infinitely harder than throwing out old clothes in your closet. But find it you must, because remember that anytime you fail to say “no” to a nonessential, you are really saying yes by default. So once you have sufficiently explored your options, the question you should be asking yourself is not: “What, of my list of competing priorities, should I say yes to?” Instead, ask the essential question: “What will I say no to?” This is the question that will uncover your true priorities. It is the question that will reveal the best path forward for your team. It is the question that will uncover your true purpose and help you make the highest level of contribution not only to your own goals but to the mission of your organization. It is that question that can deliver the rare and precious clarity necessary to achieve game-changing breakthroughs in your career, and in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarify :  When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive.  I have noticed two common patterns that typically emerge when teams lack clarity of purpose. PATTERN 1: PLAYING POLITICS In the first pattern, the team becomes overly focused on winning the attention of the manager. The problem is, when people don’t know what the end game is, they are unclear about how to win, and as a result they make up their own game and their own rules as they vie for the manager’s favor. Instead of focusing their time and energies on making a high level of contribution, they put all their effort into games like attempting to look better than their peers, demonstrating their self-importance, and echoing their manager’s every idea or sentiment. These kinds of activities are not only nonessential but damaging and counterproductive. We do a similar thing in our personal lives as well. When we are unclear about our real purpose in life—in other words, when we don’t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values—we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look good in comparison to other people. We overvalue nonessentials like a nicer car or house, or even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter or the way we look in our Facebook photos. As a result, we neglect activities that are truly essential, like spending time with our loved ones, or nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dare to say no : Saying no is not easy -  We can’t bear the thought of disappointing someone we respect and like. None of this makes us a bad person. It’s a natural part of being human. Yet as hard as it can be to say no to someone, failing to do so can cause us to miss out on something far more important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit :
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Editing aids the effortless execution of the Essentialist by removing anything distracting or unnecessary or awkward. Or, as one book editor put it: “My job is to make life as effortless as possible for the reader. The goal is to help the reader have the clearest possible understanding of the most important message or takeaway.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When making decisions, deciding to cut options can be terrifying—but the truth is, it is the very essence of decision making.In fact: The Latin root of the word decision—cis or cid—literally means “to cut” or “to kill.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit - Setting the Boundary :  Nonessentialists tend to think of boundaries as constraints or limits, things that get in the way of their hyperproductive life. To a Nonessentialist, setting boundaries is evidence of weakness. If they are strong enough, they think, they don’t need boundaries. They can cope with it all. They can do it all. But without limits, they eventually become spread so thin that getting anything done becomes virtually impossible. Essentialists, on the other hand, see boundaries as empowering. They recognize that boundaries protect their time from being hijacked and often free them from the burden of having to say no to things that further others’ objectives instead of their own. They know that clear boundaries allow them to proactively eliminate the demands and encumbrances from others that distract them from the true essentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4--execute&quot;&gt;Part 4 : Execute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when we’ve identified what is essential, eliminated the non-essential, this final part goes into how to make it work. This part is mainly focussed on productivity tips on how to get essential work done with the highest quality. This part is cumilation of many productity books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buffer - The unfair advantage:  A “buffer” can be defined literally as something that prevents two things from coming into contact and harming each other.  These days the pace of our lives is only getting faster and faster.  As a result, execution is often highly stressful, frustrating, and forced.    Here are a few tips for keeping your work—and sanity—from swerving off the road by creating a buffer.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use Extreme Preparedness.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add 50% to your time estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subtract things every day:  Instead of focusing on the efforts and resources we need to add, the Essentialist focuses on the constraints or obstacles we need to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress - The power of small win -  The key is to start small, encourage progress, and celebrate small wins. Some tips
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do the Minimal Viable Preparation every day&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Visually reward progress&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow - The genius of routine -  What we can’t do is concentrate on two things at the same time. When I talk about being present, I’m not talking about doing only one thing at a time. I’m talking about being focused on one thing at a time. Multitasking itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can “multifocus” is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be - The Essentialist Life :  MORE JOY IN THE JOURNEY With the focus on what is truly important right now comes the ability to live life more fully, in the moment. For me, a key benefit of being more present in the moment has been making joyful memories that would otherwise not exist. I smile more. I value simplicity. I am more joyful. As the Dalai Lama, another true Essentialist, has said: “If one’s life is simple, contentment has to come. Simplicity is extremely important for happiness.”&lt;/li&gt;

The key takeaway is that only once you give yourself the permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. My Notes This is a well organized book, divided in four main parts. The first part establishes the need and mindset of an Essentialist. The second part delves into how to distinguish trivial from the essential. The third part then takes us through the strategies to cut out the trivial, and the final part discuss practical aspects on how to make the essential work an effortless work. The structure of the book is well thought of, and each part builds on the previous one Part 1 : Essence “If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.” This part discuss about the need and mindset of an Essentialist, and why we need to pursue this. Three main reasons why we need a disciplined and mindful pursuit of Essentialism: TOO MANY CHOICES. We have all observed the exponential increase in choices over the last decade. Yet even in the midst of it, and perhaps because of it, we have lost sight of the most important ones. As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.” We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what isn’t. Psychologists call this “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates. TOO MUCH SOCIAL PRESSURE It is not just the number of choices that has increased exponentially, it is also the strength and number of outside influences on our decisions that has increased. While much has been said and written about how hyperconnected we now are and how distracting this information overload can be, the larger issue is how our connectedness has increased the strength of social pressure. Today, technology has lowered the barrier for others to share their opinion about what we should be focusing on. It is not just information overload; it is opinion overload. THE IDEA THAT “YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL” The idea that we can have it all and do it all is not new. This myth has been peddled for so long, I believe virtually everyone alive today is infected with it. It is sold in advertising. It is championed in corporations. It is embedded in job descriptions that provide huge lists of required skills and experience as standard. It is embedded in university applications that require dozens of extracurricular activities.

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my 3rd Half Ironman distance. 
I’ve raced this route last year, so I knew what to expect from the route and logistics (parking, transition zones etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIB Collection was planned for 16th and 17th Feb. I wanted to keep 17th Feb completely free, so collected the BIB on 16th evening itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon was spent organizing my race kit. I opened my phone, launched google tasks app where I’ve saved my Ironman Checklist. 
I organized stuff into 4 piles, as per the race transition - Pre-Swim stuff, T1 (Swim-&amp;gt;Bike transition), T2 (Bike-&amp;gt;Run), and post-event change of clothes. 
Once done, I packed everything in the car. I didn’t leave any packing for the morning. This gives me a peace of mind. Mentally settled, I went to bed around 10:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 18th Feb, was the event day. This year start was at 5 am, an hour earlier than last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up at 3:15 am. Got ready, had water and banana, and left for the venue.
Reaching Venue, I went directly to the transition area and laid down the stuff. The weather was nice. I knew it will get hot by the time run will start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, Office work had been very hectic, and I didn’t get much time to train. This was my most under-prepared race.&lt;br /&gt;
To give an idea of under-training - From Oct to Feb, I got only 3 swimming sessions, and 6-7 bike rides. Running was the only aspect on which I’ve worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to play conservative, and re-use goals from last year - 60 min swim, 3:30 hr Bike, 2:30 hr Run, and 10 min of each transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-19km---59min&quot;&gt;Swim [1.9km - 59min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swim was in SPM Indoor pool, 38 laps of the 50mts pool. I was assigned Pool2, Lane1 - sharing with 4 other athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim started at 5 am, my name was called out at 5:05 am. I ran to the pool, saw 2 other athletes jumping in the pool. 
I paused for 30 seconds, let some distance come between me and other two, and slowly started to swim.
Water temperature was nice, the pool was familiar. I tried bilateral breathing but didn’t feel relaxed with it, so decided to stick to right side breathing. 
I slowly picked the pace, overtook each athlete one by one. 
The swim was easy, nothing remarkable - I swam comfortably, and didn’t push much (none in fact). I finished it in an hour and came out of the pool at 6:05 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1413762389&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-7-min&quot;&gt;T1 [7 min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, my exit from the pool was a clumsy effort. This year, thankfully it was smooth. I quickly came out, ran to the transition area. The floor was wet, and I almost slipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my clothes lined up. I grabbed the towel, quickly dried myself, wore cycling shorts, tee, jacket, and socks. As with all my previous events, I was going to cycle in sandals. 
In my past races, I’ve realized that as the time is limited, rinsing head quickly doesn’t dry it completely, and the combination of damp hair and morning wind on the bike would make me sneeze. So this time I chose to wear my wool buff as the head scarf. A good decision!! We live and learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took about 7” in this transition. Little better than last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-90km---336hours&quot;&gt;Cycle [90km - 3:36hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cycling, it was 10 loops of 9.4km each. There was a timing mat to count all the loops. But everyone was responsible to keep a mental count of the loop - it is not so easy when the mind is getting foggy due to tiredness. 
This time there was no u-turn in the route, which was supposed to help with the speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still dark when I started to cycle (around 6:20 am). The weather was comfortable. 
Immediately after the loop start, there was a steep incline of 250mts - brutal, brutal!! Legs slowly opened up, and I maintained a steady pace of 25kmph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in the 3rd loop, a funny incident happened. I was on that incline leg, huffing and puffing through my way. Suddenly a group of cyclist overtook me, and then few more did that. They all looked so fresh. I was taken aback for a minute - I knew I was under-trained for the cycling, but not this bad that people would overtake me left, right and center. Then I saw their event tag and realized they were Olympics event participants, and have started bike leg just now! I grinned at myself on my internal panic and cycled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During all this, I was constantly on the lookout for Anubhav. Anubhav and I have been practicing together. He is still working on his swim, and a very strong cyclist and runner. He caught up with me during the 5th loop (He was 10’ behind in the swim leg). We both took our first break at 50km mark. I had an energy drink, banana and started to pedal again. 
Last 4 loops were a struggle, lack of practice was showing. Though I was trying to push hard, I couldn’t generate much power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my cycle close to 9:50 AM. When I was entering the stadium towards T2, I saw Anubhav in his running gear, about to start the run. I mentally calculated, he was about 5’ ahead now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My total bike time was 3:38, 10” more than my last time. I was disappointed, but I pushed if off from my mind - this was not the time to analyze. I had to focus on the run segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1412990584&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-6-min&quot;&gt;T2 [#6 min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a simple transition - remove gloves, sandals, helmet, wear running shoes, iPhone armband, eat a banana, and off I went. It was calm, and yet efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-211km---236hours&quot;&gt;Run [#21.1km - 2:36hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past months, my main effort has gone in running. I’ve been training with MAF method, which emphasis on the long slow run, close to your aerobic max heart rate. This not only increases the aerobic capacity but also adapts your body to burn fat as the preferred fuel. I’ve lost a lot of inches from tummy, without even trying And I was getting faster, so I knew this was working.
My aerobic threshold is 141bpm. For this race, I’ve set the target of running &amp;lt;160bpm for the first 10km, &amp;lt;165bpm for next 5, and all out for the remaining 5km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was close to 10 am when I started to run. Legs were stiff in the first 3km, but then I expected this from the past experience. After 3km, legs opened up nicely. Run was good, consistent run, with less walking breaks. Luckily, I could execute it almost as planned - I ran good, felt comfortable, and was able to increase my pace during the last 5km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished run leg in 2 hours 36min, which is 20 minutes improvement over my run from the last year. I was happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, 3rd Half Ironman was done! Last one before I go for Full Ironman, on 3rd June

Delhi International Triathlon When? Feb 18, 2018 How far? 113km (1.9km swim, 90k cycle, 21.1k run) Website? https://www.facebook.com/events/249802708811025/ Goals Goal Description Completed? A Finish Yes B Sub 7:30hr Yes C Get Nutrition Right Yes . Pre Race This was my 3rd Half Ironman distance. I’ve raced this route last year, so I knew what to expect from the route and logistics (parking, transition zones etc) BIB Collection was planned for 16th and 17th Feb. I wanted to keep 17th Feb completely free, so collected the BIB on 16th evening itself. Saturday afternoon was spent organizing my race kit. I opened my phone, launched google tasks app where I’ve saved my Ironman Checklist. I organized stuff into 4 piles, as per the race transition - Pre-Swim stuff, T1 (Swim-&amp;gt;Bike transition), T2 (Bike-&amp;gt;Run), and post-event change of clothes. Once done, I packed everything in the car. I didn’t leave any packing for the morning. This gives me a peace of mind. Mentally settled, I went to bed around 10:30 PM. Sunday, 18th Feb, was the event day. This year start was at 5 am, an hour earlier than last year. I got up at 3:15 am. Got ready, had water and banana, and left for the venue. Reaching Venue, I went directly to the transition area and laid down the stuff. The weather was nice. I knew it will get hot by the time run will start. Race Strategy For the last few months, Office work had been very hectic, and I didn’t get much time to train. This was my most under-prepared race. To give an idea of under-training - From Oct to Feb, I got only 3 swimming sessions, and 6-7 bike rides. Running was the only aspect on which I’ve worked. I decided to play conservative, and re-use goals from last year - 60 min swim, 3:30 hr Bike, 2:30 hr Run, and 10 min of each transition. Swim [1.9km - 59min] The swim was in SPM Indoor pool, 38 laps of the 50mts pool. I was assigned Pool2, Lane1 - sharing with 4 other athletes. The swim started at 5 am, my name was called out at 5:05 am. I ran to the pool, saw 2 other athletes jumping in the pool. I paused for 30 seconds, let some distance come between me and other two, and slowly started to swim. Water temperature was nice, the pool was familiar. I tried bilateral breathing but didn’t feel relaxed with it, so decided to stick to right side breathing. I slowly picked the pace, overtook each athlete one by one.

theme for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; 3.x and adds new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-simple&quot;&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall
design lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only
to Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration
variables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available,
the CSS degrades into a single column layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customization&quot;&gt;Customization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydeout replaces Hyde’s class-based theming with the use
of the following SASS variables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-scss highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$sidebar-bg-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#202020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$sidebar-fg-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;white&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$sidebar-sticky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$layout-reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$link-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#268bd2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To override these variables, create your own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assets/css/main.scss&lt;/code&gt; file.
Define your own variables, then import in Hydeout’s SCSS, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
# Jekyll needs front matter for SCSS files
---

$sidebar-bg-color: #ac4142;
$link-color: #ac4142;
$sidebar-sticky: false;
@import &quot;hydeout&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout/blob/master/_sass/hydeout/_variables.scss&quot;&gt;_variables&lt;/a&gt; file for other variables
you can override.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also insert custom head tags (e.g. to load your own stylesheets) by
defining your own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/custom-head.html&lt;/code&gt; or insert tags at the end
of the body (e.g. for custom JS) by defining your own
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/custom-foot.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hydeout also adds a new tags page (accessible in the sidebar) and a new
“category” layout for dedicated category pages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Category pages are automatically added to the sidebar. All other pages
must have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sidebar_link: true&lt;/code&gt; in their front matter to show up in
the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple redirect-to-Google search is available. If you want to use
Google Custom Search or Algolia or something with more involved,
override the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disqus integration is ready out of the box. Just add the following to
your config file:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disqus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want Disqus or want to use something else, override
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;comments.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Google Analytics support, define a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google_analytics&lt;/code&gt; variable with
your property ID in your config file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a bunch of minor tweaks and adjustments throughout the
theme.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Aa dekhe jara, kis mein kitna hai dum”&lt;/em&gt;
The alarm, with this song as its alarm tone, went off at 4 am, and I was up immediately. “Song is really apt!”, I pondered!
The event was going to start at 6 am, and I wanted to reach by 5 am.
My mind was surprisingly calm. I had packed everything last night, so there was no last-minute anxiety.
I quickly ate one banana and stepped out in the wee hours of a cold winter morning. Six months of training - of learning how to swim, running more than 7k,….today was THE DAY I have been waiting for.
Reaching the venue, I went directly to check my cycle. Everything was just as I had kept the last evening. The weather was cool and pleasant, with the Delhi winter receding. It looked like a good day to crack Half Ironman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being my first triathlon, my race strategy was quite conservative. I wanted to enjoy the event, and not walk through the run segment. Run is my weakest of 3 sports. I had planned to do 60min swim, 3:30hr ride, 2:30hr run, and 10 min of each transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-19km---59min&quot;&gt;Swim [1.9km - 59min]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim was at Talkatora in an indoor heated pool stadium. In there were 3 swimming pools, each 50m long and having 10 lanes. Our event was scheduled to be in pool no. 2
For half ironman distance, there were a total of 19 laps, back and forth, in the 50m pool length. It was a staggered start. We were assigned lanes, as per the self-predicted completion time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 5:55 am, Sangeeta Saika, the swim race director, started calling one by one, and assigned lanes.
As name call continued, my heart started beating fast. The feeling of being part of the event was sinking in! Damn! All those months of preparation and D-Day already came!
I soon heard “Rishi Sareen, Lane 5”. I waved at the announcer, crossed the timing mat, and entered lane 5. Two people were already in this lane.
As soon as I entered the pool, I focused on proper breathing to relax and concentrated on taking good strokes. I had learned swimming just a few months back, and I wanted to take it easy and be comfortable.
After 2-3 laps, I overtook other people (there were a total of 6 people now in my lane) and retained this lead throughout the swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out from the pool at 7:01 am, about 5-10min slower than my best effort. But it was a good swim.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-10min&quot;&gt;T1 [10min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something funny happened when I was exiting the pool. Entry &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; to the pool is simple - you just jump in. But, when you’ve to come out, there are no ladders, one is supposed to hoist himself up. I’ve seen athletes do this very gracefully, using their arm strength. Now, I’ve never practiced this. So, I ended up doing a very confused mix of partial pulling by arm strength, and partial throwing my leg up and hanging on to my dear life!
When I came out from the pool, organizers clapped and cheered for me. I feel they were secretly relieved that I didn’t just drown during exit! Anyway, I acted all serious, business-like (hey, the camera was around), and rushed towards transition area where I’ve kept my change of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my towel, rinsed hair, changed to cycling attire, shoes, ate a bar of snickers, and off I went.
I took about 10” for all this. Not fast, not slow, it went as per the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-90km---326hours&quot;&gt;Cycle [90km - 3:26hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cycling, it was 9 loops of 10km each. There was a timing mat which was counting all loops.
For cycling, there were two main factors bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First of all, the fear of puncture. I had learned to fix a puncture on Roadie only last evening, and I was not sure how much time I’d take in the event if this happened.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second factor was the route. This triathlon happens in heart of Central Delhi, and it gets a lot of traffic, which can really put a break on the speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to see what happens on the course. I moved towards the Starting Mat. Here I could hear a lot of cheering. It was all participating crowd and families who came to cheer.
I glanced at my watch - 7:10 AM. The weather was nice.
I started and then maintained a steady pace of 25kmph. I kept on sipping water every 25min and ate a bar of snickers every 40min.
I eased out my cycling effort in the last 10km, as suggested by coach. This was to get heart rate low and keep energy for the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling was uneventful - training on these roads during last few weeks helped a lot. And hats off to the organizers and Delhi Police - they managed traffic so well. It was as smooth as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finished cycling, it was a sigh of relief in my mind - “Look Maa, no puncture!”.
Time: 3:26 hours
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/871526263&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-10min&quot;&gt;T2 [#10min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of cycling, I was wondering whether to run in cycling shorts or change to running shorts. Finally, I decided to change - running is my weakest of all 3 sports, and I didn’t want to experiment with cycling shorts at the last minute. Good decision! I quickly changed to running shorts, ate another banana and ran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-211km---258hours&quot;&gt;Run [#21.1km - 2:58hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 10:47 AM by the time I started my run. Sun was out, and it was turning out to be a hot day. This time it was a loop of 10km, so 2 loops, and then 1km inside the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a slow run, and immediately felt a pain in right knee. It persisted for 2km, and then it got better. I met few folks from Nasik and Mumbai, who had done short distance triathlon earlier but were attempting first Half Ironman distance. And here I was - attempting my first ever triathlon, that too a Half Ironman distance. I don’t know if I was braver or more foolish :). But as the saying goes - “Stay hungry, stay foolish”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running was a pain, it went slow. I grabbed water at every aid station, ran and walked. We had formed a group of 4 people, some guys from Maharashtra and myself. We all were getting tired, and egging each other on. Towards the last 5km, Nasik guy was getting too tired. So, I paced him. It was a little surreal - me pacing someone. But we had stuck around each other for almost entire 10km, and I was not going to leave them hanging at last sprint.
Towards the last 1k, my friend Anubhav came over to pace me. I gathered final burst of energy, and finished it!
It was a bad run, but I was glad for it to be over! Lot of learning, and lot of positive takeaways!

Reaching the venue, I went directly to check my cycle. Everything was just as I had kept the last evening. The weather was cool and pleasant, with the Delhi winter receding. It looked like a good day to crack Half Ironman. Race Strategy This being my first triathlon, my race strategy was quite conservative.

&lt;p&gt;I hate the word “impossible”. Hate it, hate it, hate it! &lt;br /&gt;
Hold on, I love this word. It is actually very motivating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was summer of 2016. Anubhav and I were catching up in our office’s breakout area, discussing upcoming sports events. He mentioned two events in particular - Delhi -&amp;gt; Mumbai cycling event (1500kms over 5 days, planned in Dec 16), and a Triathlon planned in Feb 2017.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started Riding regularly, and Delhi-&amp;gt;Mumbai cycling sounded fascinating. And Triathlon - it was always enthralling thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to my desk, checked out event details. There was Duathon(Ride + Run), and Triathlon(Swim, Ride, Run) 
For Triathlon, 3 categories were available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint Distance&lt;/strong&gt;   : Swim  750m (Cut off 50mins)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 20Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 5 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 3hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olympic Distance&lt;/strong&gt;  : Swim 1500m (Cut off 1:20hrs)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 40Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 10 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 5hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HalfIron Distance&lt;/strong&gt; : Swim 1900m (Cut off 1:30hrs)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 90Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 21 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 8.5hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused, wrote down my current capability list. It read like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim&lt;/strong&gt;  : Can float, can’t breathe while swimming. Rating: 2/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run&lt;/strong&gt;   : Max distance in one go: 7km. Rating: 3/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ride&lt;/strong&gt; : This was good. I had done multiple century rides. So was not a beginner. Rating: 5/10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had to decide the event to enroll. Duathlon was never in consideration for me, it had to be triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accessed all the factors carefully - my current capability, magnitude of challenge in hand, limited time with the Job, personal time and Commitments. After weighing all these carefully, I &lt;strong&gt;“wisely”&lt;/strong&gt; went ahead and signed for the biggest badass event - Half Ironman distance!! I guess it just ticked my flag of &lt;strong&gt;“is this crazy enough”&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
I signed up on 7/May/2016 for this. Event date was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;19 Feb 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-planning&quot;&gt;The Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had three monsters to slay - Learn Swimming, Learn Running and improve Cycling conditioning so I can run post cycling.  &lt;br /&gt;
I started by doing what I do best : Reading! I did a ton of research. I read about individual events, also about lessons from other IM70.3 / Ironman finishers. This helped me understand better on the challenges that lied ahead.  &lt;br /&gt;
During this research, I also consistently came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://trianewlife.com/&quot;&gt;TriANewLife&lt;/a&gt;. TriANewLife offered IM70.3, Full Ironman coaching programs. I sent enquiry on the portal, and their founder/chief coach Deepak Raj reached out to me. I had already researched about Deepak by then, and was very impressed. His profile page captured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Successfully completed 13 IronMan Triathlons (3.8 km swim, 180 km cycling, 42.2 km running) with a best time of 10 hrs 19 min and 08 sec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ranked #31 in world wide rankings for 2014 in IronMan Age Group Rankings (35 to 39 year age group)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Successfully completed 12 Marathons (42.2 km running) with a best time of 2 hrs 59 min and 53 sec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah!! Holy Shit!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepak and I scheduled a call. On phone, I immediately connected to his training philosophy. He took time to understand my current level, my goals, my time commitments. He was quite optimist that I can successfully reach to the level I’m aspiring for.  &lt;br /&gt;
He decided to take me in for online coaching. I was little hesitant on how online coaching would work - I always thought I would have someone working with me in physical proximity. So, reporting progress online sounded unsure. But Deepak’s program had no long term lock-in. Fees was paid every month, with option to stop coaching whenever needed. This was precisely the flexibility I was looking for. I signed up for the program and started this from end July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D was done now, time for execution started. 6 months to go. Event date: &lt;em&gt;19 Feb 2017&lt;/em&gt;. Bye bye sleep. Bye bye parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-philosophy&quot;&gt;Training Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I embark on this training, and during this training journey too, I made some rules for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small and Be Consistent:&lt;/strong&gt; I was 38 when I started this training, and had no steady fitness history. I don’t recall if I did any sport unswervingly for more than few months.  So, it was important for me to keep taking small continuous steps. Consistency, more than excellence, was my focus area. I’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/books/book-review-superhuman-by-habit-by-tynan.html&quot;&gt;so much&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/habits/habit-forming-50-first-dates-report.html&quot;&gt;habit forming&lt;/a&gt;, this was the time to walk the talk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Live to die another day”:&lt;/strong&gt; From the start, my final goal is to Full Ironman, and be long term fit. It was super important to stay injury free. I decided to listen actively to body cues. There were days when office work was very high, family commitments were there. I just focused on continuing baby steps, be flexible in adjusting plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment:&lt;/strong&gt; I started with telling everyone I met, about HIM, and that I was doing it. This level of public commitment ensured I stick to my plan. This strategy worked well, as, in my mind quitting was not even an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swimming&quot;&gt;Swimming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the biggest beast to slay, and naturally my first focus area. In Delhi, swim weather confines from April to Sept. This further reduced my “Swim time window”. I and Anubhav decided to learn swimming at DDA Dwarka sports complex.  We reached out to the pool coach there, and agreed for 2 months of training for 5K INR per person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a personal pool coach was a good, and a much needed idea. Unfortunately, we had many challenges from the start. Firstly, coach was not fixed, was changed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each coach had its own instructing methodology, which often contradicted from other coaches. Our first coach taught “hold the breath, swim, go on as long as you can, capacity will come”. Other coach told us to breathe every stroke. Now, holding breath might work in short distances but for long distances, this will quickly exhaust. Also, all coaches were focused on short distance speed. They were pushing that we do strong and continuous leg movement. Again, good(?) for short distance. I had my Goal clear - Ironman. So, exhausting legs in swim itself was not a smart idea. &lt;br /&gt;
Only worthwhile thing I learnt from the coach was, how to stand in water (called treading the water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at all this, I explored alternatives in parallel. I recalled listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, where he mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://tim.blog/2008/08/13/total-immersion-how-i-learned-to-swim-effortlessly-in-10-days-and-you-can-too/&quot;&gt;“Total Immersion”&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
Total Immersion is a different approach towards swim. Its primary focus is to teach swimmers to move through the water efficiently while staying relaxed in water. Now Geek in me is always obsessed with efficiency. So, when I had read this program in past, it made huge sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-read the book, and started to closely follow TI Vdeo Program (Easy Freestyle) Video program is divided in chapters, designed for self learning one chapter at a time. I went through the videos, and started to practice the drills. Something changed this time - maybe I was committed for IM70.3, maybe I had Anubhav with me to watch and give feedback, maybe I was ready to learn now. I believe it was a mixture of all 3 factors. Finally I moved quickly in swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For last few years, I’ve been striving to achieve some fitness milestone on my b’day. In 2013, I cycled for 75km, in 2014 it was 100km, in 2015 I increased the distance to 200km. So, this year I pushed myself and completed 50mts swim nonstop on my b’day. It felt so awesome!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;
Energized by this achievement, I renewed focus on my fundamentals - hand position, head position, getting comfortable in 7ft pool. From August to Sept, I pursued that. In Sept, I did another leap - moving from 50mts nonstop to doing 1km nonstop. September was a turning point in many a way, right motivation can do wonders. Finally, swimming was enjoyable. I could swim, relax and let my mind wander - all at the same time! Such a nice feeling it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Sept, as Dwarka pool closed, we joined Sirifort pool. 
In November and December, I did few swims there. As the winters progressed it got tougher to deal with climatic conditions in the morning especially as my swim timings were 6am to 7am. &lt;br /&gt;
I used to leave from home at 5:15am, in pitch dark and cold, swim from 6 to 7, go back to home in time to drop Riya to school. It was crazily hectic but swimming was so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jan, I signed up for Talkatora. It has 7ft pool, and it was event venue. I wanted to practice in 7ft pool before the event. This was more of a mental battle - scare factor of swimming in 7ft pool, and no Anubhav to watch my back. For few initial swims, I used to curse myself that why i’m taking such hassles. Mind can be very tricky. Somehow, I knew I had to persist, and eventually it did get easier. Now, I can swim comfortably in deep water. This helped immensely in event day eventually.  &lt;br /&gt;
By now, I was averaging 30min per km, which is not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running&quot;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarka swimming pool closed on 30/Sept. I knew, it was the time to pull up my socks and aim for becoming Forest Gump. Till this time, I had done few runs here and there, but no structured plan. 
To start with, I decided to do Airtel Delhi Half Marathon (ADHM) which was on 20th Nov.  &lt;br /&gt;
The progress was good, as I improved quickly from pace of 8-8.5min/km to 7.5min/km. My max distance quickly increased to 15km. But I started to get knee pain, especially on left knee. It got that bad that I would start getting pain in 3km of run itself. Damn!! &lt;br /&gt;
I was in a state of fix. I understood that i’ve increased my mileage too fast, and my posture was not correct. As time was running out for ADHM, I tried small steps to slow down my running speed, but the pain persisted throughout November. The week preceding ADHM, it was a decision point - to continue, or not to continue with ADHM. I was adamant that I would go ahead and participate. Ain’t pain the ritual through which I’ll become a better runner? But I was adviced (to the point of scolding) that it doesn’t make sense to take chance of permanent injury. So, VERY VERY reluctantly, I withdrew from ADHM. It proved to be right thing to do. “Live to die another day”. &lt;br /&gt;
I paused at this point, and focused on form. Saw many online videos. In particular, advice of “Running Fast and Injury Free” by Gordon Pirie resonated well with me. Like Zen like swimming of TI, Gordon Pirie’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110124045734/http://www.williamsichel.co.uk/documents/Running_Fast_and_Injury_Free.pdf&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; focus much on form and relaxed running. I focused on right posture and correct foot strike. I also changed my shoes, and got Nike Free Air. Form adjustment and right running shoes helped immensely. I went from strength to strength. Knee pain dissipiated when I allowed myself to recover for 10 days. Deepak slowly increased my running mileage.  &lt;br /&gt;
I did my 1st Half Marathon on 1/Jan/2017 in Bali Hills. It took close to 4 hours, including all the breaks. But best part was that there was absolutely no knee pain, and I was kicked to do more. I did another 21.1k distance on 8th Jan, and I was all set for the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cycling&quot;&gt;Cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only reason I could even think of enrolling for IM70.3 was that I had a cycling base. I had been cycling on and off since last year, and could go till 100km easily. In preparation, I did short rides. I did a 200km brevet (30/July) and  300km brevet (10/Sept)
Bought Trek Emoda Road Bike (Road Bike, Race Geometry) a month before the event.  &lt;br /&gt;
Sometime in December, I decided not to go for Delhi Mumbai cycling event. As, I was not completely comfortable with my running, and decided to focus on that. Again, a tough, but I believe a wise decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nutrition&quot;&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continued to proceed on this journey, I realized two things very quickly - clean food is very important, and so is rest. So, I put focus on eating clean as much as I could - avoided fried food, sugar, high carbs. I also focused on sleeping 7-8 hours a day whenever possible. This is often neglected, but again vital part of recovery.  &lt;br /&gt;
Eating clean not only helped me to improve my performance, but had a surprising and welcome impact of shedding weight. I went from 85kg to 77kg, and waist went from 36-37inches to 33 inches! Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-few-weeks&quot;&gt;Final Few Weeks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For last 3 weeks, I trained around Talkatora area, to get myself familiar with route. This proved to be a smart decision (see,consistently smart I’m ;)). Cycling route for my event had lot of inclines, for which I’ve not practiced at all. These 3 weeks gave me time to prepare for that. One week before the event, Anubhav and I did a good fast 10k on that route (1:02hr time, my best 10K so far). This also boosted my confidence level. I collected my event BIB on that day itself from The Bike shop, Green Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here I was. All ground work done, time put in, feeling all ready and anxious for the event. Fingers were crossed!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Sareen</name><email>rishi[at]jigyasu[dot]com</email></author><summary type="html">Why I Tri’ed - The Background story I hate the word “impossible”. Hate it, hate it, hate it! Hold on, I love this word. It is actually very motivating! It was summer of 2016. Anubhav and I were catching up in our office’s breakout area, discussing upcoming sports events. He mentioned two events in particular - Delhi -&amp;gt; Mumbai cycling event (1500kms over 5 days, planned in Dec 16), and a Triathlon planned in Feb 2017. I’ve recently started Riding regularly, and Delhi-&amp;gt;Mumbai cycling sounded fascinating. And Triathlon - it was always enthralling thing to do! I went back to my desk, checked out event details. There was Duathon(Ride + Run), and Triathlon(Swim, Ride, Run) For Triathlon, 3 categories were available Sprint Distance : Swim 750m (Cut off 50mins) Ride : 20Kms Run : 5 Kms Total Cutoff Time: 3hours Olympic Distance : Swim 1500m (Cut off 1:20hrs) Ride : 40Kms Run : 10 Kms Total Cutoff Time: 5hours HalfIron Distance : Swim 1900m (Cut off 1:30hrs) Ride : 90Kms Run : 21 Kms Total Cutoff Time: 8.5hours I paused, wrote down my current capability list. It read like this : Swim : Can float, can’t breathe while swimming. Rating: 2/10 Run : Max distance in one go: 7km. Rating: 3/10 Ride : This was good. I had done multiple century rides. So was not a beginner. Rating: 5/10 Now, I had to decide the event to enroll. Duathlon was never in consideration for me, it had to be triathlon. I accessed all the factors carefully - my current capability, magnitude of challenge in hand, limited time with the Job, personal time and Commitments. After weighing all these carefully, I “wisely” went ahead and signed for the biggest badass event - Half Ironman distance!! I guess it just ticked my flag of “is this crazy enough”. I signed up on 7/May/2016 for this. Event date was 19 Feb 2017. The Planning I had three monsters to slay - Learn Swimming, Learn Running and improve Cycling conditioning so I can run post cycling. I started by doing what I do best : Reading! I did a ton of research. I read about individual events, also about lessons from other IM70.3 / Ironman finishers. This helped me understand better on the challenges that lied ahead. During this research, I also consistently came across TriANewLife. TriANewLife offered IM70.3, Full Ironman coaching programs. I sent enquiry on the portal, and their founder/chief coach Deepak Raj reached out to me. I had already researched about Deepak by then, and was very impressed. His profile page captured: Successfully completed 13 IronMan Triathlons (3.8 km swim, 180 km cycling, 42.2 km running) with a best time of 10 hrs 19 min and 08 sec. Ranked #31 in world wide rankings for 2014 in IronMan Age Group Rankings (35 to 39 year age group) Successfully completed 12 Marathons (42.2 km running) with a best time of 2 hrs 59 min and 53 sec. Woah!! Holy Shit!!! Deepak and I scheduled a call. On phone, I immediately connected to his training philosophy. He took time to understand my current level, my goals, my time commitments. He was quite optimist that I can successfully reach to the level I’m aspiring for. He decided to take me in for online coaching. I was little hesitant on how online coaching would work - I always thought I would have someone working with me in physical proximity. So, reporting progress online sounded unsure. But Deepak’s program had no long term lock-in. Fees was paid every month, with option to stop coaching whenever needed. This was precisely the flexibility I was looking for. I signed up for the program and started this from end July. R&amp;amp;D was done now, time for execution started. 6 months to go. Event date: 19 Feb 2017. Bye bye sleep. Bye bye parties. Training Philosophy Before I embark on this training, and during this training journey too, I made some rules for myself: Start Small and Be Consistent: I was 38 when I started this training, and had no steady fitness history. I don’t recall if I did any sport unswervingly for more than few months. So, it was important for me to keep taking small continuous steps. Consistency, more than excellence, was my focus area. I’ve read so much on habit forming, this was the time to walk the talk. “Live to die another day”: From the start, my final goal is to Full Ironman, and be long term fit. It was super important to stay injury free. I decided to listen actively to body cues. There were days when office work was very high, family commitments were there. I just focused on continuing baby steps, be flexible in adjusting plans. Commitment: I started with telling everyone I met, about HIM, and that I was doing it. This level of public commitment ensured I stick to my plan. This strategy worked well, as, in my mind quitting was not even an option. Swimming This was the biggest beast to slay, and naturally my first focus area. In Delhi, swim weather confines from April to Sept. This further reduced my “Swim time window”. I and Anubhav decided to learn swimming at DDA Dwarka sports complex. We reached out to the pool coach there, and agreed for 2 months of training for 5K INR per person. Having a personal pool coach was a good, and a much needed idea. Unfortunately, we had many challenges from the start. Firstly, coach was not fixed, was changed frequently. Each coach had its own instructing methodology, which often contradicted from other coaches. Our first coach taught “hold the breath, swim, go on as long as you can, capacity will come”. Other coach told us to breathe every stroke. Now, holding breath might work in short distances but for long distances, this will quickly exhaust. Also, all coaches were focused on short distance speed. They were pushing that we do strong and continuous leg movement. Again, good(?) for short distance. I had my Goal clear - Ironman. So, exhausting legs in swim itself was not a smart idea. Only worthwhile thing I learnt from the coach was, how to stand in water (called treading the water). Looking at all this, I explored alternatives in parallel. I recalled listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, where he mentioned “Total Immersion”. Total Immersion is a different approach towards swim. Its primary focus is to teach swimmers to move through the water efficiently while staying relaxed in water. Now Geek in me is always obsessed with efficiency. So, when I had read this program in past, it made huge sense. I re-read the book, and started to closely follow TI Vdeo Program (Easy Freestyle) Video program is divided in chapters, designed for self learning one chapter at a time. I went through the videos, and started to practice the drills. Something changed this time - maybe I was committed for IM70.3, maybe I had Anubhav with me to watch and give feedback, maybe I was ready to learn now. I believe it was a mixture of all 3 factors. Finally I moved quickly in swimming. For last few years, I’ve been striving to achieve some fitness milestone on my b’day. In 2013, I cycled for 75km, in 2014 it was 100km, in 2015 I increased the distance to 200km. So, this year I pushed myself and completed 50mts swim nonstop on my b’day. It felt so awesome!!!!!! Energized by this achievement, I renewed focus on my fundamentals - hand position, head position, getting comfortable in 7ft pool. From August to Sept, I pursued that. In Sept, I did another leap - moving from 50mts nonstop to doing 1km nonstop. September was a turning point in many a way, right motivation can do wonders. Finally, swimming was enjoyable. I could swim, relax and let my mind wander - all at the same time! Such a nice feeling it was. Post Sept, as Dwarka pool closed, we joined Sirifort pool. In November and December, I did few swims there. As the winters progressed it got tougher to deal with climatic conditions in the morning especially as my swim timings were 6am to 7am. I used to leave from home at 5:15am, in pitch dark and cold, swim from 6 to 7, go back to home in time to drop Riya to school. It was crazily hectic but swimming was so worth it. In Jan, I signed up for Talkatora. It has 7ft pool, and it was event venue. I wanted to practice in 7ft pool before the event. This was more of a mental battle - scare factor of swimming in 7ft pool, and no Anubhav to watch my back. For few initial swims, I used to curse myself that why i’m taking such hassles. Mind can be very tricky. Somehow, I knew I had to persist, and eventually it did get easier. Now, I can swim comfortably in deep water. This helped immensely in event day eventually. By now, I was averaging 30min per km, which is not bad. Running Dwarka swimming pool closed on 30/Sept. I knew, it was the time to pull up my socks and aim for becoming Forest Gump. Till this time, I had done few runs here and there, but no structured plan. To start with, I decided to do Airtel Delhi Half Marathon (ADHM) which was on 20th Nov. The progress was good, as I improved quickly from pace of 8-8.5min/km to 7.5min/km. My max distance quickly increased to 15km. But I started to get knee pain, especially on left knee. It got that bad that I would start getting pain in 3km of run itself. Damn!! I was in a state of fix. I understood that i’ve increased my mileage too fast, and my posture was not correct. As time was running out for ADHM, I tried small steps to slow down my running speed, but the pain persisted throughout November. The week preceding ADHM, it was a decision point - to continue, or not to continue with ADHM. I was adamant that I would go ahead and participate. Ain’t pain the ritual through which I’ll become a better runner? But I was adviced (to the point of scolding) that it doesn’t make sense to take chance of permanent injury. So, VERY VERY reluctantly, I withdrew from ADHM. It proved to be right thing to do. “Live to die another day”. I paused at this point, and focused on form. Saw many online videos. In particular, advice of “Running Fast and Injury Free” by Gordon Pirie resonated well with me. Like Zen like swimming of TI, Gordon Pirie’s book focus much on form and relaxed running.

Riya: “Swimming pool to hoga na?” &lt;br /&gt;
Ryan: “Hum hotel jaa rahe hein?” &lt;br /&gt;
Me (wondering): “This river rafting at Bharamputra seems very cool. Need to check” &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip planning is a serious business. Biggest question usually is where to go. Actually, no! Biggest question is chutti kitni hai? How many days of vacation can we take? Ok for both of us? Ok for Kids? Ok for parents, who were joining us this time? So, aligning dates, and then the right place to go (as per weather) is the first question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this trip, atleast we had an initial plan - Cherrapunji! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had one week to spare before our parents joined us. We initially explored going to Bhutan for a week from Guwahati but dropped the plan for 2 reasons: 1) Delhi-Bhutan airfare is almost same as Guwahati-Bhutan. So didn’t make sense. and 2) The flight to Bhutan was sold out for our dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wife and I took out NE Map, started exploring areas. We also looked into 8 days package from popular travel companies - Makemytrip, Cleartrip etc, to get an idea of what are the popular sightseeing options. Now we generally don’t do all “touristy” stuff, but it is a good area to start investigation from. And ofcourse, tripadvisor and indiamike.com are my fav sites to explore in detail. &lt;br /&gt;
One remark here - since past many years, we always make only high level tentative plans, and never booked a package tour. This gives us a lot of flexibility when we reach the place - some new places to discover. This was to happen in this trip too - we could discover Majuli River Island, and Maple Pine Farm only because we had a flexibility. Ofcourse, this way is not for everyone. But if you can travel like this, it is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, back from digressing. Trip dates were settled, tentative list of places was settled. We were going to go to Tawang in Arunachal, and then join parents on 12th May at Guwahati, to go to Meghalaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went over what all to take, what would be the weather, how we’ll commute (luggage depends on that). Discussion and planning went on till 7th Morning, which was our journey start date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Geography Teacher to class: “Name the place which gets max rainfall in a year” &lt;br /&gt;
We all shouting, trying to impress the teacher: “Cherrapunji!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with Cherrapunji.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other kids, I first read about Cherrapunji during school time. Our education system is famous for making us remember countless useless trivia. This was one of them. But somehow name of this place stayed with me.
My entire childhood  was in Delhi, where summers are merciless. Monsoon season is the time when whole earth smiles, flowers bloom, sun takes a rest and it is pleasant all around. As far as I remember, I’ve always been in love with rains. No wonder I could not forget about the place where it rains the most! Cherrapunji!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few years back, I read a novel - “Twilight” and saw the movie series. Now, in this movie, hero is a vampire, who can’t be out in the sun (Vampires, you see! They don’t have very sunny disposition). So he has to always stay where very less sun, and it rains. Whole novel was set in Forks, Washington where it rains a lot. Now, novel was forgettable, movie even more so. But visuals of lush green all around with rain pouring in were awesome. Bought back my thoughts about Cherrapunji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months back, I read an article on indiamike about living root bridge trek in Meghalaya. And where is this living root bridge? Cherrapunji! I was sold, had to visit this place now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whole north east trip planning started with Cherrapunji as “must-visit”. Rest were all afterthought places. And I was in for some surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In following articles, I’m going to capture the journey:&lt;/p&gt;
