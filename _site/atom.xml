    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-preparation&quot;&gt;Race Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goa 70.3 was just 2 months after my &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/ironman-copenhagen-aug-19-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Full IM in Copenhagen (Aug ‘19)&lt;/a&gt; . IM CPH was a disappointing race, as I was not too happy with my performance in the bike section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the next two months, I decided to focus primarily on nailing the bike leg. My limitation in CPH was unable to hold the aero position. So, I made some adjustments in the bike - replaced aero bars with newer, more comfortable aero bars and got more hands on experience. Soon I saw improvements with my speed averaging to 30+ average on a few rides. Coming to the race, I was feeling strong for the bike and I was confident of getting a good time on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strategy for goa  was to complete the swim in ~45min, then 3:15 for the bike, 2:15 for the run. 6:30 was my goal, with 6:15 being an ambitious goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nutrition strategy was  ~150 calories per hour and proper electrolytes. As I’m fairly fat adapted, I only needed to top up muscle glycogen to keep my blood sugar up while racing. As this was not my A race, I could afford to experiment and see body’s response. During the training too, I was doing well for 3 hour workout with just pre-workout coffee and electrolytes during the workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race-days&quot;&gt;Pre-Race Days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Goa 70.3 race was a special race for many reasons. This is the first ever Ironman event being hosted out of India. Triathlon is a very fast growing sport in India. 96% of the participants were Indians, and whooping 84% were FIRST TIMERS!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were nervous jitters all around, particularly on the swim aspects. Swimming is not a very common sport in India.&lt;br /&gt;
P.S: I also learnt swimming AFTER I signed up for my first half ironman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days before the race, I went for a practice swim with Anubhav and Rohin. The water was choppy but I had a good relaxed time in the sea. This is the first time I didn’t panic in the sea. I don’t know what was the difference was, nevertheless I had a good swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Race Day was finally here.
Getting up at 4am, I had a light breakfast - 4 Scrambled Eggs and Coffee with Butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reaching the race venue, I filled air in the bike, fixed water bottles, mounted Garmin Edge and laid down stuff for two transitions T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon it was announced that start was delayed by 30”. I used that time to click selfies with friends - best way to distract and not think about the race.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; T1 - Lot of Nervous Energy Around &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim was a self-seeded start swim, with 4 athletes released to get in the water every 6 seconds. It was a 2 loop swim. The water at the start was not too deep, with 100m of walk before one could swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I self-seeded myself in 40-45min group. About 2 min after the first athlete entered the water, I entered the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First loop was easy. The sea was very choppy wth strong waves. I stayed close to the ropes, so less sighting to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of loop, water became very shallow. Everyone had to stop and walk almost 150m. This was a huge waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First loop was done in 26min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second loop was almost identical - choppy water, with walking towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 52min
Total Swim done: 2200m
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2802529131&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: Nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1&quot;&gt;T1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a 500m walk from swim exit to the T1. I quickly reached T1, wore tri top, shoes and left for road. A volunteer pointed out that I’ve forgotten to wear helmet. I had to rush back and get helmet. I was laughing at my haste :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 7min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-90km&quot;&gt;Cycle [90km]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike course was 3 loops of 30km each. Each loop has two steep elevations, with one being a 10% gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ride started easy. But immediately, I faced a technical snag. I realized my aero bars were undone and were completely loose. This was a surprise, as just a day before I did route recee, and checked everything including aero bars. I still do not know how come they were undone. My guess was someone fiddled with them while
the bike was parked overnight. Anyways, I had no time or thoughts to waste on that matter and gathered my mind to focus in rectifying the bars and moving on with the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did first loop while hanging on the drop bar. My bottle fell off during the ride. Not a good start to my ambitious bike leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first loop, I stopped bike at an aid station and shouted for Allen Key number 4. The mechanic came running, and quickly fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Climbing the badass incline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First 30km came in 62min. Second in 65min, and third took 62min. It was overall a very consistent effort on the bike. I finished with overall average of 28.4kmph, which is not bad for the course and wasted time due to aero bar issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 3hr 9min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2802529249&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;
Nutrition: Gel every hour. Precision Hydration Salt capsule every hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2&quot;&gt;T2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling good on finishing the bike ride. I quickly changed in my Vibrams and went off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 5.5min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: Nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-211km&quot;&gt;Run [21.1km]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was out in the complete glory by the time I started running. Running was a 7km loop, so had to be done 3 loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit stiff in the first 500m, but then legs opened up and I could maintain easy pace of 6:30min/km. First 7km was done in 46.5min. Starting second loop, I started to fatigue a bit. I took my first gel here and salt capsules. At the first loop end, I met another Radstrong friend and we decided to run together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second 7km was done again in 46min. During this time, fatigue was settling. I was dosing myself with water and ice at every aid station. The volunteer crowd was really good. They were cheering us at every sight. When you are tired, then any motivation is most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third loop, while tough, was mentally less daunting. With every passing km, it was one km close to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final loop was done in 48min, with last km done at pace of 5:30. It was done!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End time: 2hr 19min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava Link : https://www.strava.com/activities/2802529248&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: 2 gels + coke every aid station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 6 hr 35min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-race&quot;&gt;Post Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good race. Swim was a bit of disappointment, but I executed bike and run well. It was a hot day and tough route and I’m glad of overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I discovered that I got 19th position in my Age Group, missed World Championship Qualification by 5min. I’m now determined to go back next year and nail it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy with bike and the nutrition. I had only 5 gels and lot of salt caps, and nowhere I went low on the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second Full Ironman after last year &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/ironman-philippines-june-18-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Philippines Ironman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had done good practice for this, particularly the bike and run part. Swim is a challenge in Delhi, particularly the pool access. Most of the pool closes from October to March.&lt;br /&gt;
Copenhagen was going to be cold swim (17-18degree) and it would be my first time wetsuit swim.&lt;br /&gt;
My strategy was to complete the swim in ~90min, then follow Heart Rate for Bike (MAF Zone) and Run (MAF+20 Zone)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race-swim&quot;&gt;Pre-Race Swim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before the race, I went for a practice swim. This was my first open water swim in a wetsuit, and 4th open water swim overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was cold and murky. After few minutes of feeling the water, I started to swim. But I’ve not gone even 20m when I started to hyperventilate. I quickly turned back towards the short.
I felt the tight wetsuit was closing in on my chest. I decided to remove the underneath tri-top. This helped, and breathing was less labored.
But now I was in no mental space to try deep water swim again. I did some shallow water strokes and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic in Open Water Swim is something I’ve always struggled with. But experience is a wonderful thing, by past experience, I knew race day would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-38km&quot;&gt;Swim [3.8km]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Race Day was finally here.&lt;br /&gt;
Getting up at 4am, I had a light breakfast - 4 Scrambled Eggs made in Ghee + 1 Glass of Milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Metro to the venue. The metro was packed with athletes. For a packed metro, it was very quiet. Everyone was in their zone, preparing for the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reaching the start point, I filled air in the bike, fixed water bottles, mounted Garmin Edge and finally wore the wetsuit. Post this, I went for a short run to heat up the body. Once all this is done, I went for a swim warmup. By now, I was in very calm state. I went in sea, did bubbling for a minute, then did few good strokes. Good to go!

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; With Blossom  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim was a rolling start swim, with a release of a group of 4 athletes for every 6 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Rolling Start - 6 people enter water together &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro Females started at 7am.
For Age Groupers, we were divided in 5 Zones, based on our predicted swim timers. I had taken Green cap this time which indicated 1:18-1:22 swim time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Swim Line Up &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon people with Green caps started to line up. I didn’t want to wait anxiously for my turn to come, hence went right ahead to start of the line.&lt;br /&gt;
Entering the water, it was nice cold. Nothing shocking or unbearable - body was nicely warmed up by now.&lt;br /&gt;
I started with slow breathing and gradual strokes. Soon I found my Rythm, and time flew quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
Crossing two bridges, I reached first turnaround at 1600m. Here water was very shallow and weeds were all around. - getting in legs, face, arms. It was a bit of mind scare. But no option but to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly  reached close to end line and came out of the water. I didn’t stop at all during the swim, and it was a comfortable swim.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 1hr 30min&lt;br /&gt;
Total Swim done: 3950m&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2632087446&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: 1 gel 15” before the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1&quot;&gt;T1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripping off wetsuit took some time as there were no wetsuit strippers and I was very new. The transition was bit longer compared to my plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 15min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-180km&quot;&gt;Cycle [180km]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whosoever has said Copenhagen bike course is flat must be from Europe. It is surely not flat from Asian standards :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course starts easy, first 15km are flat and we move from the city to the sea shore. The route here was mesmerizing - swimming with sea on the right.&lt;br /&gt;
After 45km, we take turn and enter the village side. From here it was mostly rolling hills, with no real stretch for continuous ride.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Lovely scenic villages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 85km mark, 3rd aid station came and I took first washroom break. By then I was getting exhausted with the climbs and it had started to rain also from an hour back. The rain was to continue for remaining bike and some part of the run too.&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Loop 2, energy was dipping. I managed to hang on, and kept doing the mental calculation of the end time. I desperately tried to finish this under 7 hours, but finally finished it little over 7 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; My patent pose &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 7hr 08min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2632088221&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Nutrition: Gel every 45min. Banana + Bars via the Aid station. I don’t think I managed to get properly 100gm carbs per hour. I also lost my salt capsules somewhere during the bike. Paid price for this in the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2&quot;&gt;T2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so glad to hand over the bike and go in a standing position. I quickly went towards the run bag. I took out Vibrams and rinsed my mouth with mouthwash. Mouthwash helps to reset the taste of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 8min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: 2 Salt Crackers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-422km&quot;&gt;Run [42.2km]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running is something I had really worked on from last Ironman. I have gone from 2:36 Half Ironman to 1:53 Half Ironman. So, now I was not scared of finishing the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run was 4 loops, with each loop of 10.5km. The run route is a torture, not so much from the terrains and cobblestones, but from the fact that it’s four laps. In each lap, you’ve option to go either to finish line or continue. The finish line was just 50m away and you could hear the noise from Announcers on the mic. You do this four times! Yep four times being forced to stare down the finish chute, but until you have those four rainbow wrist bands, you can not pass go and proceed to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started run comfortable at 6:30pace, keeping an eye on HR which was steady 141bpm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started coke at 12km distance, and from there I held on to it.&lt;br /&gt;
Till 23km, I didn’t stop and managed to keep a pace of 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 23km, I did my first walk to aid station, and boy what a bad decision it was. Till then, I was just running, ignoring my mind. But as soon as I stopped, my mind went in overdrive - “how nice does it feel” and “how tired we are”. My legs have taken bad beating due to cobblestones path in the route. It is tough on ankle, even more when you are running close to barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019_08_18_IMCPH/Race/20190818-11-Run-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot; Lovey crowd support throughout the Run &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Lovey crowd support throughout the Run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last 10km were a struggle. I’m still not sure if I bonked, or I was mental fatigued. But I had no energy in leg to push forward. First 21km came in 2:15, Next 21km came in close to 3hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to the finish line, I sprinted. Blossom was there at the end line, who very kindly handed over Indian flag to me. I finished smiling, with flag on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From India, Rishi Sareen, you are an Ironman”. It was so good to hear these words again.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava Link : https://www.strava.com/activities/2632087560&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition: 3 gels + coke every aid station after 10km + Salt crackers. After 30km, it was very difficult to eat anything. That could have caused the bonking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 14:22hr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-race&quot;&gt;Post Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt very disappointed with the race. Unhappy - no. But disappointed. I had trained hard for this race, and was hoping for a sub 13. But Bike leg took a lot out of me.
I’m ofcourse grateful to have the chance to race this, and in the amazing city of Copenhagen. But I could have done better. Lot of lesson learnt - particularly the importance of staying aero on the bike and no backup plan for losing salt capsules.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2019-04-28T06:02:18+05:30</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish is an excellant food - full of Protein, Omega 3 and essential vitamins and minerals. I love to grill fish - it is healthiest form of consuming fish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basa Fish Fillets - 1kg (I prefer Basa as it is boneless and easily available)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ghee - 2 spoons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black Salt - 1/4 tbsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepper - 1/4 tbsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemon - 1&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;serving size: 2-3 person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:#####&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring Fish to Room Temperature. If in hurry, defrost setting of microwave can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mix Ghee + Black Salt + Pepper in a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Lemon, apply the above mix on the fish generously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put in a glass / microwave safe plate and put in microwave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Microwave, Using Grill + Microwave Combo. Almost all microwave have it. I use Combo 2 - 50% Microwave power, 50% Grill. Start timer of 8 min.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 8 min is over, take fish out. Apply the mix again to moisture the fish. Turn side, and start timer for another 8min.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once done, now use the microwave setting, and let it for 5 min.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serve and Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes:#####&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care to apply ghee properly on the fish sides too. That is an area which usually gets missed out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MAF Method - Update</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-update.html"/>
   <updated>2019-04-14T13:07:47+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a strong believer in the MAF Approach to the endurance training. I apply the heart rate training principles to both running and cycling.
I wrote about maf method in two article series - &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/running/maf-method-part1.html&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/running/maf-method-part1.html&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 41 year old, and my MAF range is 134-144bpm. I’ve been training consistently with this method for 1+ year, and my MAF Pace has slowly come down from 8:40min/km to 6:40min/km. This is a saving of 2min per km. In a half marathon distance, this is a saving of 40min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s blog, I want to share my recent progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give an example of 2 runs I did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half Marathon Race @ Amritsar - Jan 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half Marathon Practice MAF Run @ Delhi - Apr 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevation was similar. Amritsar was a colder weather, which is easier for the running. Still Delhi run was far easier&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9.2 Deg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;29.1 Deg&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For similar pace, my Heart Rate was lower by 27 beats. This is huge saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my runs are easy MAF Run. I do introduce speedwork closer to the race, but that is never more than once a week.
Best thing about MAF Runs is that it needs zero recovery, as it is done in a very comfortable heart zone. And as Heart rate is so controlled, the form doesn’t drop. In 2 years of regular training, I had zero injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey continues.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goa TriCamp Report - March 2019</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/triathlon/goa-tricamp-report-march-2019.html"/>
   <updated>2019-03-31T19:28:24+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/triathlon/goa-tricamp-report-march-2019</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Coach (Kaustubh Radkar) has planned for a 3 days Triathlon Camp in Goa. It was from 8th March to 10th March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the participants were preparing for &lt;a href=&quot;http://eu.ironman.com/triathlon/events/asiapac/ironman-70.3/goa.aspx&quot;&gt;Ironman 70.3 Goa&lt;/a&gt;. Kaustubh and Indrajeet were our coaches for the camp.⁣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Goa Airport at 2PM from Delhi. As Camp was supposed to start at 4, I immediately fetched a Bike Taxi to Hotel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalcentregoa.com&quot;&gt;The International Center&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Friday, only one session was planned - Open Water Swim Session. This session’s focus was on key sea swimming skills - Sighting and Backfloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few guys from Pune had cars. We packed ourself in the car, and reached the session venue - Bambolin Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are swimming in the pool, there is no need to lift our head and sight. Pool is usually 25 or 50m in length, and we’ve a dedicated lane.&lt;br /&gt;
But when one is in open water, there is no intuitive way to swim in a straight line. If sighting is not done properly, people tend to drift away. This is likely the most common and costly problem faced by people new to open water swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaustubh and Indrajeet showed us how to integrate sight with the stroke. For me, they corrected how much head to lift (tip: very less lift needed), how to time the headlift with the pull - this gave a very easy bounce. ⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
I have done open sea swim as part of Philippines Full IM. But my sighting was clumsy and tough on the neck. In this session, I could immediately feel the difference - this was an effortless way to sight, and it felt amazingggggg!!!⁣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BackFloat&lt;/strong&gt;   ⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
I used to wonder why do I need to do the back float. But Indrajeet made a good point. If during the swim, Goggles come off (or you are tired and want to pause), the back float is the easiest way to handle the situation.⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
I have &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; been able to back float. Never. I’ve tried (and failed) many times - much to the amusement of my family. But kudos to Indrajeet as a teacher - he made a very small correction in my technique, and YES - I could back float. Oh boy! Even if I might not use this skill during the event, it felt amazing to be finally able to do this.⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
A very useful session indeed! Everyone came out from sea smiling, the joy of new skills acquired :) ⁣

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⁣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
6:15AM-6:45AM : Morning Run with small hills. 30” run.⁣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7AM - 8 AM : Swim session in the sea (Caranzalem Beach, Next to Miramar Beach). This session built on the backfloat. We learnt how to move from freestyle to backfloat, adjust the goggles, and continue to swim. When we got hang of it, it felt so awesome⁣.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10-10:30: Nutrition session with Kaustubh and Maitreyi⁣. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;500 500 Listening to the Nutrition Talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11AM-12PM : Swim session in the pool. This was a technical session, focused on sculling and right leg movement. Some videos were also shot by the coach :-D⁣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:30PM - 1PM : Sun was blazing, and we were tired. Perfect time to simulate the race day. Kaustubh made us run for 30” in the sun. During Ironman, it is very important to be able to run with the tired legs. This was a good simulation. Maitreyi and I did a comfortable 5km⁣ run. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;0 Run in the heat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4-6PM: Now, with all the drills and technique, this was the time to face the fear. This session called for us to go inside deep sea. Indrajeet (25m) and Kaustubh(50m) were our targets :D. Everyone did this comfortable - big reason was the practice in the sea sessions before.⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
A hectic, but super wonderful day. The group was super awesome, and together we all did this sea swim easily.⁣ &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;0 Happy faces post the session &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⁣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
⁣6:15AM-6:45AM : 3 repeat of the hill, followed by a surprise extra hill loop. Coach (@radkar82) had a big grin on his face, on successfully surprising us with the extra loop 😊⁣⁣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7AM - 8AM: Back to the sea. This time everyone was looking forward to it. Not much time was wasted, we directly decided to go to the deep sea. Water was choppier today, but the group took this as another chance to learn. ⁣⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
The swim was easily done, with some practice on sea entry and exit too.⁣⁣ &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
And that was the wrap of 3-day session. ⁣⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
⁣ &lt;br /&gt;
The beauty of this sport is not only you get to learn so many skill, but meet so inspiring people. Everyone is in the journey to improve themselves and succeed together.⁣⁣ &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>My Top 5 Triathlon Podcasts</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/triathlon/my-top-5-triathlon-podcast.html"/>
   <updated>2019-03-24T16:24:43+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/triathlon/my-top-5-triathlon-podcast</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my last article on podcast, I shared &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/podcasts/my-top-5-podcasts.html&quot;&gt;my top 5 fav podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced podcasts and shared my top 5 favorite podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the theme, I want to share few of my Triathlon focussed podcasts. While there are tons of Triathlon specific podcasts, some of them really resonates with my training philosophy. Here are few of them:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-purple-patch-fitness&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://purplepatchfitness.com/education/podcasts&quot;&gt;Purple Patch Fitness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/podcast/PurplePatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Purple Patch Fitness&quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Purple Patch Fitness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Dixon is one of the top coaches in the Triathlon world. He has a talent of reducing the complex topic to basics, and reducing it to “actionable advice”. His coached triathletes have wom max podium finishes.&lt;br /&gt;
His podcasts are short (30min to an hour), and packed with actionable knowledge. Particularly his series on nutrition and hydration are just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-pursuit-of-the-perfect-race&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coachterrywilson.com/perfect&quot;&gt;Pursuit of the Perfect Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/podcast/PerfectRace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Pursuit of the Perfect Race&quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Pursuit of the Perfect Race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coach Terry describes his podcast as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love seeing, hearing, and experiencing the pure emotion of athletes when they overcome obstacles, challenges and hardships to accomplish the previously thought to be impossible.  Challenging athletes to be better, do better, and not make the mistakes of others is important to me. I network with athletes all over the world to discover their victories, challenges, disappointments, mistakes they made, and how they found what worked for them through a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He focus primarily on the race day -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Details about the Race - Swim / Bike / Run Portion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T1/T2 setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support Arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What went right / wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He covers both professional triathletes and amateurs. Best part is the podcasts are arranged by races. So if you’re going to race a particular Ironman, you can listen to that particular episode to get an idea of what to expect there.  I’ve already listened to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coachterrywilson.com/ironman-copenhagen&quot;&gt;Ironman Copenhegan&lt;/a&gt; episode twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-that-triathlon-show&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientifictriathlon.com/that-triathlon-show/&quot;&gt;That Triathlon Show&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; That Triathlon Show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast is geared towards tips on swimming, running, cycling and nutrition. A wealth of knowledge. Mikael Eriksson, the host of the show, is himself a very good triathlete, who is improving very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-triathlon-taren&quot;&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://triathlontaren.com/topics/general/&quot;&gt;Triathlon Taren&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; Triathlon Taren Podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taren is an all around crazy, and fun guy. And is such a fabulous storehouse of knowledge. I’ve heard each one of his podcast, and learnt a ton. Along with podcast, he also have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1AKDrz2GvLxD29W9tow66g&quot;&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt; where one can find a lot of useful triathlon learning videos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerry Rodrigues, host of this show, is a towering figure in the world of Open Water Swimming and Triathlon swimming. Many professional triathletes rates him as the best swimming coach. This podcast is focussed more towards Triathlon Swimming, and many great episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honorary Mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxygenaddict.com/podcast&quot;&gt;Team Oxygen Addict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trispecific.com/category/podcast/&quot;&gt;The Fat Black Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, folks. If you’re training for Triathlon, and love listening to podcasts, these are some very valuable and fun resources to get started. It is a good way to spend time during those long training rides.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MAF Method - Part2</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-part2.html"/>
   <updated>2019-03-16T07:55:27+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-part2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/running/maf-method-part1.html&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed the importance of Aerobic Base Building.&lt;br /&gt;
In this part, we focus on the “how-to” aspect of it. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maf-method&quot;&gt;MAF Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very simple, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate your MAF Heart rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a heart rate monitor while you run to make sure you don’t exceed this rate. Stay 0-10 beats below it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oh, and make sure you spend about 15 minutes warming up by gradually increasing your heart rate to this max number. Cool down for 15 minutes at the end, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us go deep in each of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calculate-maf-heart-rate-recap&quot;&gt;Calculate MAF Heart Rate (Recap)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find your maximum aerobic training heart rate, there are two important steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subtract your age from 180.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify this number by selecting among the following categories the one that best matches your fitness and health profile:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Category 1 : Recovering from illness or on medication? Subtract 10.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Category 2 : Frequently sick or regressed in training? Subtract 5.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Category 2 : Overfat — simply use the waist-to-height ratio. Your waist should be less than half your height — if it’s not, subtract 5.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Category 3 : If you have been training consistently (at least four times weekly) for up to two years without any of the problems in above, keep the number (180–age) the same.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Category 4 : Been training regularly for 2 yeara, and improving without problems? Add 5.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-heart-rate-monitor&quot;&gt;How to use Heart Rate monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, wrist based Heart Rate Monitors are not very accurate. Wrist based HR monitor actually measures pulse and not directly HR. Also, the pulse reading is impacted by many factors - tightness of the band, hair on the skin, surrounding light. It is good to measure when stationary, but gives variance during a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend to invest in a good Chest Based Heart Rate Monitor. &lt;br /&gt;
Most of good Chest Based HRM come with 2 transmission protocol - ANT and Bluetooth. ANT allows to connect to your smartwatch, and Bluetooth allows to connect to your iOS/Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, you can pick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.decathlon.in/p/8334795_dual-ant-bluetooth-smart-heart-rate-monitor-strap.html&quot;&gt;Geonaute from decathlon.&lt;/a&gt;. It is a good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;
Other very good brands are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/heart-rate-monitors/wahoo-tickr-heart-rate-strap&quot;&gt;Wahoo Tickr&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;= Go for Ticr, TicrX is overkill for most people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/pn/010-12883-00&quot;&gt;Garmin HRM&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;= If you into triathlon, then Garmin Tri is a good one to pick.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polar.com/en/products/accessories/H1_heart_rate_sensor&quot;&gt;Polar H1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure to wet the strap before wearing it. And wash it with soap water after 3-4 use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run---warmup&quot;&gt;Run - Warmup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warmup helps by gradually increasing the flow of blood sent to muscles will help them burn fat better, use oxygen more efficiently and decrease chance of injury. Sudden start of the run increases HR very quick.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No stretches for the warmup. One should warmup for 15min with a light run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a complete 15min warmup before you start the run. This is &lt;strong&gt;MANDATORY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Divide this 15min in 5 sets of 3min each.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With each set, increase the intensity up to increase HR by 10-12beats. Target is to reach your MAF zone by end of the warmup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warmup Sample (Each set is of 3min)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set1 =&amp;gt; Normal Walk =&amp;gt; HR: 80bpm for example&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set2 =&amp;gt; Increase to brisk walk to increase HR to 90bpm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set3 =&amp;gt; Increase to a very light jog, or run + walk. Increase HR to 100-105bpm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set4 =&amp;gt; Jog for longer time, increase HR to 115bpm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set5 =&amp;gt; Continue Jog, increase HR to 125bpm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run---main-set&quot;&gt;Run - Main Set&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set an alarm on your watch or phone - to alert you if you reach your MAF Heart Rate. I’ve an MAF of 145, so I usually put an alarm of 140.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using Garmin watch, it has alarm functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using phone, I recommend Wahoo Fitness App. It is free, and you can add/customize alerts. One can later upload workout on Strava from Wahoo App itself (if it is not on strava, it didn’t happen :))
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Slow down when alarm goes off . Sometime you might need to walk to bring the HR back to range.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For workout &amp;gt; 60min, take hydration - preferably water with electrolyte.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cooldown&quot;&gt;Cooldown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5-10 min of cooldown - reverse of warmup. Slowly come to stop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small stretches ok to do here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips-for-beginners&quot;&gt;Tips for Beginners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Patient&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
MAF Method works, and deliver fantastic results while keeping you healthy. But this is low progress - initially in the start. Most of the beginners have to walk most of the time. It is frustrating, many people give up there - assuming no progress is there. Remember, it took your body years to be that aerobically unfit. So progress will not come overnight. Usually it takes 3-4 months before you see the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the full warmup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am repeating myself, but don’t skip on this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Main to max 90m&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Dr Maffetone suggests that the aerobic gain decreases marginally after 90min. If you’ve time, you can do 2 sets - one in morning and one in evening. But any single set should be under 90min.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAF is your maximum HR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lot of beginners assume it is good to get your average HR as MAF. It is not. You should not exceed your MAF HR during the main set. Ok, few seconds here and there is ok, but generally you should slow down before hitting max HR.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Temperature is the Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If weather is too hot, then body also move blood to skin to make it sweat and cool down. This also increase Heart Rate. So, in summers, good time to do MAF is early morning or evening, when weather is coolor. Or, one can go to the Gym.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the Deep Breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As MAF run is slow in the beginning, and effort is less, it is best time to focus on the running form and deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Maffetone Group on FB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is a wonderful group, and most of the beginners questions are answered there. Good to know that you are not alone in the struggle. You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1452390158396719/&quot;&gt;group here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips-for-advance-runners--cyclists--endurance-athlete&quot;&gt;Tips for Advance Runners / Cyclists / Endurance Athlete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to increase MAF pace in lesser time, consider doing workout 4-5 times a week. Weekly mileage of 40-50km will give a very quick run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As we discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/running/maf-method-part1.html&quot;&gt;part1&lt;/a&gt;, Fat is most clean fuel to burn. Fasted runs helps not only to progress quicker in MAF pace, but also helps to burn fat as the fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now. I will add in more tips later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following MAF method for more than a year. Not only it has made running a pleasure, but helped me to get faster while staying injury free. Two months back, I did a Half Marathon in 1:58, and my av HR was 154.&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to reach out to me, would love to connect to people trying this out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MAF Method - Part1</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-part1.html"/>
   <updated>2019-03-10T12:16:16+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/running/maf-method-part1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;maf-method---background&quot;&gt;MAF method - Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAF stands for Maximum Aerobic Function. This method deals with building aerobic base. This is applicable to all sports &amp;gt;5min in duration. This is one of the most powerful way to train.&lt;br /&gt;
Dr Phil Maffetone pioneered this method. Many top athletes, in a variety of sports, have followed this method to achieve top success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Triathlete magazine, Mark Allen is the greatest triathlete ever. He won six Ironman World-Championships.&lt;br /&gt;
His secret? &lt;strong&gt;Maffetone Method.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach is discussed in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The science behind aerobic training&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/running/maf-method-part2.html&quot;&gt;How-to approach the MAF Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People usually jump on the “how-to” part. While it is important, understand the “why” part is also critical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;basics---aerobic-system-vs-anaerobic-system&quot;&gt;Basics - Aerobic System vs Anaerobic System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic:&lt;/strong&gt;   The ability of the body to use more fat and less sugar (glucose) for energy. One needs oxygen to burn energy here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anaerobic:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability of the body to use more sugar and less fat for energy. No Oxygen needed to burn energy in Anaerobic state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Aerobic System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The conversion of fat to energy—fat burning—takes place in the aerobic muscles (these are sometimes called slow-twitch or red muscle fibers).&lt;br /&gt;
Humans  are well endowed with these muscles and they are the ones depended upon during activity of longer duration—they can function well for many hours and even days in a well-trained athlete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Birds Fly More Than 10,000 Kms &lt;strong&gt;Nonstop&lt;/strong&gt; In Its Annual Fall Migration. The birds weigh no more than 700gm when they leave. Half of that is fat, which they burn off completely during the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of fat burning is possible in humans too, if trained properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Anaerobic System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sugar (glucose) is converted to energy in the anaerobic muscles. These are sometimes called fast-twitch or white muscle fibers. &lt;br /&gt;
They are used for short-term power (such as weight lifting) and sprint speed (such as an all-out 100 meter race). These attributes are used very little in endurance sports.&lt;br /&gt;
Anaerobic energy is also very limited—relying only on this system won’t even allow a 5K race to be completed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/MAF/Aero2.PNG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-aerobic-system-is-important-to-train&quot;&gt;Why Aerobic System is important to train&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maffetone tells us that, in an event that lasts longer than one hour, 98% (!!!) of the endurance energy used is derived from our aerobic system. &lt;br /&gt;
If the event is over two hours, 99% (!!!) of the endurance energy will come from our aerobic system. Therefore, if you want to be a great endurance athlete, you’d be wise to build a VERY strong aerobic base.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Aerobic vs Anaerobic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
](/images/MAF/aerobic-and-anaerobic-energy.png)  


# Keep slow run slow and fast run fast.   
The aerobic system–which is the most important energy system of the body–can’t be trained as effectively at higher heart rates. Few things happen when are in higher HR / Anaerobic zone:  

- Anaerobic training can decrease the number of aerobic muscle fibers, sometimes significantly. This can happen in just a few short weeks.   
- Anaerobic training raises your respiratory quotient, meaning that fat burning is reduced and sugar burning is increased, encouraging further use of anaerobic function and less aerobic activity.   
- Excessive amounts of lactic acid produced during anaerobic training may impair aerobic muscle enzymes, reducing aerobic function.   
- Anaerobic training typically causes athletes to consume more refined carbohydrates because of an increased craving for sugar. This can increase insulin levels and further interfere with fat burning, reducing aerobic function.  

That’s why all elite athletes do 80% of their training at an easy speed or intensity: they (and their coaches) know the importance of aerobic development.  
It’s usually the amateurs that do 60 to 80% of their training more intensely in an effort to “catch up” the miles.  
 But the body’s just not built for that, so they get hurt.   

# The MAF Formula  
Dr. Maffetone, based on his research, has shown that your Maximum Aerobic Function peaks at a heart rate equal to 180 minus your Age.  

[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/MAF/maf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Aerobic vs Anaerobic &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Aerobic vs Anaerobic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
](/images/MAF/maf.png)  

Dr Maffetone suggests adjustments based on these factors:  

- Category 1 : Recovering from illness or on medication? Subtract 10.  
- Category 2 : Frequently sick or regressed in training? Subtract 5.  
- Category 2 : Overfat — simply use the waist-to-height ratio. Your waist should be less than half your height — if it’s not, subtract 5.  
- Category 3 : If you have been training consistently (at least four times weekly) for up to two years without any of the problems in above, keep the number (180–age) the same.  
- Category 4 : Been training regularly for 2 years without problems? Add 5.   


In the next article, we will cover the training approach in detail.

   <title>Nutrition - Practical Tips #1</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-practical-tips-number-1.html"/>
   <updated>2019-03-03T16:16:31+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-practical-tips-number-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve covered basics of nutrition, and how carbs trigger high insulin response, which causes weight gain and other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in next few articles, we will discuss few practical approaches towards controlling blood sugar, and utilizing fat as the body fuel.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-intermittent-fasting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Intermittent Fasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What:&lt;/strong&gt;  It’s simple: alternating periods of eating with periods of not eating.
IF has been around for a long time. Most religions preach a form of fasting from time to time. Either by restricting any kind of food altogether or by restricting some food groups from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that periodic fasting can cause a healthy decrease in blood glucose and insulin, improve immune function, and reduce excess body fat and weight. These are the keys to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, among other chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; There are different intermittent fasting methods. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:2:&lt;/strong&gt; This method allows you to eat normally five days a week. The other two days are your fasting days, although you do still eat. Just keep it between 500 and 600 calories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat-stop-eat:&lt;/strong&gt; With this one, you restrict all food for 24 hours, once or twice a week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16/8:&lt;/strong&gt; You eat all of your daily calories within a shortened period — typically 6 to 8 hours — and fast for the remaining 14 to 16 hours. You can do this every day, or a few times a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion and experience, 16/8 is the most sustainable way, and one can easily make this a lifestyle. The most effective food-free period is a daily 16-hour nighttime fast, when we sleep best. This can be done by finishing healthy eating in the early evening, then beginning the cycle again with a delayed morning breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;
One should start it gradual, go with 12 hours fast, and slowly increase it to 14 and then 16 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people like to drink black coffee in the morning (no sugar, no milk). This helps in the start to go over the craving hump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-eat-food-with-low-glycemic-index&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eat Food with Low Glycemic Index&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very important stuff to understand. Few minutes spent in understanding this would go a long way in your health. There are two concepts one need to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Glycemic Index&lt;/strong&gt;?
The glycemic index measures how quickly food raises your blood sugar. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose (sugar) given a value of 100.
Fast-burning carbs are high on the GI scale and they spike blood sugar sharply.
Some examples of High GI Food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pure glucose (GI of 100)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;baked potato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;many refined breakfast cereals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;most of our modern starchy foods (white bread, snack foods and biscuits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Glycaemic Load?&lt;/strong&gt;
The effect of a carbohydrate food on blood sugar levels is not only determined by its GI or carbohydrate quality but also by the amount of carbohydrate in a particular food. Glycaemic Load is the term used to describe the overall effect of these two factors on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GL of a potato (GI around 90) containing approximately 18 grams of carbohydrate is 18 x 90% = 16.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GL of an apple (GI around 40) containing approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate is 15 x 40% = 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this we can see the potato will produce a blood sugar rise three times that of the apple. When foods have similar amounts of carbohydrate, GI will have the greatest influence on blood sugars. When the amount of carbohydrate in a portion differs the best way to predict blood sugar effects will be via the GL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GI of watermelon is high (GI = 72), but its Glycaemic Load is relatively low (GL = 7), because the quantity of carbohydrate in a slice of watermelon (150 g) is minimal, as it contains a lot of water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Nutrition/GI-Insulin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glycemic Index impact on Insulin &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Glycemic Index impact on Insulin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GL and GI are similar concepts, except that GL takes serving sizes into account. It is calculated by taking the number of grams of carbohydrate in a serving, multiplying by the GI, and dividing by 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should attempt to eat food with low or medium GI/GL. This would help in keeping blood sugar in control.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nutrition - The Carb Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-the-carb-challenge.html"/>
   <updated>2019-02-24T13:13:48+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-the-carb-challenge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, we covered the basics about Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will dig deeper into Carbs, and particularly sugar.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blood-sugar&quot;&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of Blood Fasting Test.
Normal non-diabetes Fasting blood sugar is &lt;strong&gt;70-100mg/dl&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us use this range, and do some basic maths now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blood Volume in Average Adult = 5L&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blood Sugar Lower Range = 700mg / lt x 5L = 3500mg, or 3.5gm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blood Sugar Upper Range = 1000mg / lt x 5L = 5000mg, or 5gm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human has average blood sugar of 3.5-5gm. That is ONE teaspoon of sugar. &lt;strong&gt;In the entire blood stream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Nutrition/BloodSugar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blood Sugar &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Blood Sugar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything more than this is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-role-of-insulin&quot;&gt;The Role of Insulin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, human body has evolved to handle such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we eat Sugar (in direct form or Simple Carbs), our body gets into action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enzymes in the small intestine break it down into glucose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our pancreas are closely monitoring blood sugar level. When it goes beyond the safe range, insulin is released to control it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insulin can store the excess sugar in fat cells, for future usage.
    &lt;blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Nutrition/InsulinLocker.png&quot; alt=&quot;700 700 Insulin acting as key to store fat &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;700 700 Insulin acting as key to store fat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulin Resistance (IR):&lt;/strong&gt; Over time, chronic daily insults and stress on the pancreas to produce insulin several times a day eventually insulin resistance will develop. Now when cells become insulin resistant metabolic syndrome of one sort or another begin to develop. This is the onset of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carboydrates--sugar&quot;&gt;Carboydrates == Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most health conscious people know sugar is “BAD”. However, we do not realize easily digestible carbohydrates breakdown into &lt;strong&gt;SUGAR&lt;/strong&gt; in your bloodstream! &lt;br /&gt;
This includes rice, whole-grains,  potatoes, many fruits, some nuts, beans/legumes and other foods people commonly believe are healthy and should be eaten in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Nutrition - A Primer</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-a-primer.html"/>
   <updated>2019-02-17T19:00:02+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/nutrition/nutrition-a-primer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we discussed why fixing nutrition should be the first priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us spend some time understanding basic nutrition.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bodies have a whole of nutrition needs in order to survive and function. It can be split into two different types of nutrients: macronutrients (needed in large quantity - carbs, fats, and protein), and micronutrients (neede in less quantity - vitamins and minerals).  Both are very important and plays a vital role in our overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;macronutrients&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macronutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Nutrition/macros.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;**Macronutrients** &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;**Macronutrients** &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/Nutrition/macros.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three macronutrients all have their own specific roles and functions in the body and supply us with calories or energy. For this reason, the body requires these nutrients in relatively large amounts to grow, develop, repair and feel good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is to understand how each macronutrient plays a different role in the body and tailor your diet accordingly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be scared of fats! Fats are an essential part of a healthy diet. For many years, fats were labeled as the main villain, and people were wrongly adviced to shun fats. The market is flooded with low-fat products. Still, obesity has become endemic. Something has gone seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a landmark article by New York Times, it was found that Coca Cola and other sugar-based companies actually paid researchers money to point health crisis blame on the fat. It is an eye-opening read- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fats help by improving brain development, overall cell functioning, protecting the body’s organs and even helping you absorb vitamins found in foods. If you care about your health, you should research and let go of Fat scare.
  Of course, it does matter how are you consuming fat - eating trans fat (found in many commercially used oils) is the worst thing you can do for your body.
 We will discuss more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of healthy fats: Ghee, Olive Oil, Butter, Almonds, walnuts, seeds (pumpkin, chia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein&lt;/strong&gt;
Protein is essential for repairing and regenerating body tissues and cells, a healthy functioning immune system and manufacturing hormones. Proteins play a part in all of our bodies’ functions from our nervous system to our digestive system, and our entire body, skin, cells, DNA, etc. are all made up of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic block in protein is Amino Acids. In total there are 20 types of amino acids,  9 of which are ‘essential’ - it can’t be produced by our body, and can only be found in certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good sources of protein: Chicken, Meat, Fish, Eggs. In Veg - Paneer, Tofu, Nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We use carbohydrates for quick energy - they are your body’s favorite source of fuel because it doesn’t take a lot of work to get energy from carbs. Our bodies easily break down this macronutrient into glucose (sugar) which is the same type of sugar found in your blood. The amount of carbs you need each day can differ from one person to the next based on activity level, weight, muscle mass, overall health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good source of carbs: Green leafy and other forms of vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;micronutrients&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micronutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Nutrition/micros.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;**Micronutrients** &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;**Micronutrients** &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/Nutrition/micros.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called “micro” nutrients because they are needed only in very small amounts, these substances to not provide any calories but enable our bodies to produce enzymes, hormones, and other substances vital to development, disease prevention, and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minerals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The body does not manufacture minerals, but they are found in a variety of foods - dairy, meat, nuts, fruit, vegetables. Examples include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, sulfate, magnesium and iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all foods have the same types and amounts of minerals; and too little or too much of any mineral is not healthy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/vitamins-and-minerals&quot;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has detailed information on healthy amounts of minerals and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Molecules that the body cannot manufacture but needs for growth and maintenance. Two exceptions are Vitamin D, which can be produced internally from sun exposure, and Vitamin K2, which can be produced by intestinal bacteria. Both can also be obtained from food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamins are either fat-soluble (D, E, A, and K) or water-soluble (folate/folic acid, B series, and C). They have many functions in the body - Vitamin A helps grow and maintain eyes, teeth, bones, soft tissues and skin; Vitamin C is used in the immune system and is an antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamins are most prevalent in fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts; but some are also in meats and dairy. Similar to minerals, too little or too much is not good. Vitamin C must be consumed regularly or scurvy will occur, but large doses of Vitamin C supplements can cause diarrhea, nausea, and other problems.  Dietary supplements can also interfere with medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With basic nutrition explaination out of the way, in next article we’ll use this knowledge to discuss on weight loss strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exercise and Weight Loss</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/nutrition/exercise-and-weight-loss.html"/>
   <updated>2019-02-09T19:01:01+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/nutrition/exercise-and-weight-loss</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She: You’re so lean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Me: Thank you. I try to eat clean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She: No no, you’re slim because you work out so much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of conversation is a pet peeve of mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I love to work out. It keeps me fit and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT, that is NOT the biggest contributor to my body weight. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise has many benefits. It improves cardiovascular health, increases immunity, keeps your energy levels great throughout the day. And many more benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone should do some basic exercise. We humans, are evolved to move. A sedentary lifestyle is killing more people than Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if your goal from exercise is weight loss, please pause for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the below chart. This is for a 68k person. Add/Subtract 10% for each +-7kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Exercise&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Intensity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Calories/30 min&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Aerobics&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Light&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Vigorous&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;300&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Walking&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;105&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Running&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;320&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;350&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cycling&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16km/hr&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;220&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Swimming&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;25meters/min&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;165&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40meters/min&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;240&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Weight Lifting&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Light&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider calories in some common foods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Food&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Calories&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Chapati&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Masala Dosa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Samosa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;150&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Tea/Coffee&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;70-80&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Coke&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;150&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;McDonald Paneer Spicy Wrap&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;818&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ice cream (normal serve)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;350-400&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Dominos Cheese-Burst Pizza 1 Slice&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;210&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause and Reflect on this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat one spicy wrap, and then run for 90 minutes to compensate.&lt;br /&gt;
Eat one extra chapati, and walk for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
I love Dominos Cheese Burst Pizza. But did you know it is loaded with so much calorie.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe you knew but didn’t care. Just two slices of pizza would need an hour of  Aerobics to burn it off. And who stops at just two slices of pizza??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Exercise is awesome. I would be the last person to discourage anything from exercising. But, if your goal is weight loss, check your intake first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember this:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
##Your nutrition decides how much you weigh.&lt;br /&gt;
##Your exercise decides where that weight is distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I will write on how small changes in diet can bring massive improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I did 10000 pushups in 2018, and how you can do it too</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/habits/10000-pushups.html"/>
   <updated>2019-02-02T09:44:51+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/habits/10000-pushups</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Success is doing a half-dozen things really well, repeated five thousand times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are always fascinated by new. New places to discover, new people to meet, new things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m someone who loves to learn. There is always something to learn - A new language to learn, new skills to master, new commute routes to explore.&lt;br /&gt;
But there is often a challenge attached with the process of learning. When we start learning, the first phase is interesting - we are making quick gains and acquiring skills. But soon after that, learning slows down, the phase comes when progress is not very apparent, and that is where many people quit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book “The Dip”, Seth Godin actually explains this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are three stages along the way to mastering something. The first is the initial stage, where the learning is quite fun and enjoyable and you’re excited by learning new things. The third stage is mastery and continual growth, where you feel very confident in your skills. “The Dip” refers to the period between the two, which is often a slog filled with lots of practice and hard work, but no sense yet that you are mastering what it is you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many businesses expect you to quit and take advantage of it. They provide certain services expecting many people to pay but not use the service (like gym memberships).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution? How does one keep going in the face of dip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the outstanding book “Daily Rituals - How the Artists work”, Mason Currey studied some of the most accomplished people. Among them, novelists, poets, playwrights, painters, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, who describe how they subtly maneuver the many (self-inflicted) obstacles and (self-imposed) daily rituals to get done the work they love to do. One theme that consistently comes up is power of daily habits, and showing up even when one is not inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, that is the key solution to get past the dip. Some of our best intentions fail because we don’t have a system of execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start of 2018, I decided to experiment on this. I decided to get better at doing pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book “The Compound Effect”, Darren Hardy states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It takes 300 instance of positive reinforcement to turn a new habit into an unconscious practice — almost a year of daily practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I will do 10,000 pushups in 2018. Why 10,000, you may ask? While 10,000 pushups is not an insane challenge, it is not a small number either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how I went about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-break-down-goal-into-small-manageable-chunks&quot;&gt;1. Break down Goal into small manageable chunks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a system for yearly goals.
Start of the year, I decide on my yearly goals in different areas. Each Goal is then distributed over 4 Quarters,  each quarter is further divided into monthly milestones.&lt;br /&gt;
Monthly milestones are short enough to not lose the motivation, and big enough to make some impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 10000 pushups a year. I distributed it to 2500 pushups every quarter, or 800 pushups every month. 
On further reduction, it came to be &lt;strong&gt;just 30 pushups a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-track-it-on-weekly-basis&quot;&gt;2. Track it on weekly basis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most vital part of the planning. &lt;strong&gt;What gets measured gets improved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to track all the pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many solutions - App Based, Online Journals, Paper based solution. I wanted simple, fast tracking , which was available everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided on Google Tasks for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Start of every week, I would create a task with goals for that week. And subtasks for each day of the week to track. I actually made a template excel for this, I add week number and dates are filled automatically. Sample &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-mHjsayC9Z7-EnqfYbXihC0o9HUoagopwwlzPXgcHI/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Pushup.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Tasks to track Pushups &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Google Tasks to track Pushups &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/Pushup.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
So, target was 30 pushups a day. I decided to spread those 30 pushups over day - 3 sets of 10 pushups. Most of us can do 10 pushups. Distributing pushups across the day avoided the tiredness,  allowed myself to do it on the daily basis. Some days are good, some days gets missed. The idea is to trend towards the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this distributed pushups, I needed to set myself regular reminder.  Some people set periodic alarms, some have fixed time, some write it down on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in IT, I took an online approach.  I open Google Chrome browser multiple times a day. I used an extension “Tab to Tasks”. This display Google tasks as default page on every new tab. Whenever I would open Chrome, I would get reminded of pending pushups.&lt;br /&gt;
You might have a different solution, the core idea is to give yourself regular reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-result-12500-pushup-in-2018&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Result: 12500 Pushup in 2018!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied this Daily Habit and learning to many aspects of my life. This allowed me to achieve some other goals too in 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed One Full Ironman - Triathlon of 3.8km swim, 180km cycle, 42.4km run - All done under 17 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed 2 Half Iron distance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I worked out for 230 days in 2018. That is 60% of days I worked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, my friends, is the power of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-choices--consistency--time--significant-results&quot;&gt;Small choices + consistency + time = Significant results.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: The Goal system I follow is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://liveyourlegend.net/get-your-free-2019-weekly-planning-and-goal-setting-guides/&quot;&gt;Live your Legend&lt;/a&gt; system. My own Goal system, which I’m following since 2015, can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kqNoLGhg0gcGH80RUnB3E3QtJ-I6eP0vRI6897SsMII/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Book Review - So Good They Can't Ignore you</title>

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-Read on : 2019-01-20&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rating : 7/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124&quot;&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main summary in 3 lines - The advice of blindly follow your passion is not only overrated, but dangerous. Make yourself valuable. Use that leverage to gain more freedom and autonomy.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport main argument is “The passion hypothesis is not just wrong, it’s also dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Telling someone to “follow their passion” is not just an act of innocent optimism, but potentially the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newport suggests that instead of &lt;strong&gt;blindly&lt;/strong&gt; following your passion, you should try to build valuable skills that lead to “career capital” which will help us create our dream jobs and careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-1-dont-follow-your-passion&quot;&gt;Rule #1 Don’t follow your passion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Passion Hypothesis” - Do what you love, and money will follow. Lot of self help books teaches the important of just following your passion. But there are 2 main challenges against this hypothesis, and 2 reasons why Cal dislikes this mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first is that “follow your passion” assumes that people have a pre-existing passion they can identify and use to make career decisions. However, most people have no idea what they want to do and can end up feeling lost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second challenge is that even if you’ve a passion, you need to be good at something to do something with it (or make yourself good at something). Before one can chase passion, it is important to build the skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you. This mindset is how most people approach their working lives. There are two reasons why Cal dislike the passion mindset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, when you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don’t like about it, leading to chronic unhappiness. This is especially true for entry-level positions, which, by definition, are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy—these come later. When you enter the working world with the passion mindset, the annoying tasks you’re assigned or the frustrations of corporate bureaucracy can become too much to handle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, and more serious, the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are essentially impossible to confirm. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused, which probably explains why Bronson admits, not long into his career-seeker epic What Should I Do With My Life? that “the one feeling everyone in this book has experienced is of missing out on life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal gives an example of amateur photographers or bakers who open up businesses but end up facing extreme financial difficulty that leads to unhappiness. “That’s because having work that you love is a lot more complicated than, ‘Hey, I like this thing! If I do it for work, I’ll like my work!’” explains Newport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t follow your passion. Instead, “let your passion follow you, in your quest to become so good you can’t be ignored,” says Newport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-2--be-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-or-the-importance-of-skill&quot;&gt;Rule #2 : Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You (Or, the Importance of Skill)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Deliberate Practice** : To become “so good they can’t ignore you”, one needs to do deliberate practice - an approach to work where you deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you’re comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance. Musicians, athletes, and chess players know all about deliberate practice. Knowledge workers, however, do not. This is great news for knowledge workers: If you can introduce this strategy into your working life you can vault past your peers in your acquisition of career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-3-turn-down-a-promotion-or-the-importance-of-control&quot;&gt;Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (Or, the Importance of Control)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous rule, Newport discuss on how to acquire  career capital. Your next step is to use your mastery to negotiate for more &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt; in your job.
“Once you’re really good at something, that by itself isn’t enough,” says Newport. “You have to use your skills as leverage to take control of your working life, whether through your work hours, vacation time, or projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 main control traps one should be aware of :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The First Control Trap : Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Second Control Trap : The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you’ve become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Financial Viability&lt;/strong&gt;
When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do what people are willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to decisions affecting your core career, money remains an effective judge of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it literally means customers paying you money for a product or a service. But it can also mean getting approved for a loan, receiving an outside investment, or, more commonly, convincing an employer to either hire you or keep writing you paychecks. Once you adopt this flexible definition of “pay for it,” this law starts popping up all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-4-think-small-act-big-or-the-importance-of-mission&quot;&gt;Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big (Or, the Importance of Mission)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually this involves mastering a small field, and getting to the edge of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triathlon. Goa. Jan weather. On discovering this race, I signed up immediately.&lt;br /&gt;
This would be awesome way to start 2019. Or so I thought!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days before the race, I had a small fishing accident where my right knee banged against the rock. 
In next days, the pain got bearable, and I continued my training. I could not afford to skip training. Past 4 weeks had gone by with no training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even after 5 days of accident, the pain was not going away. On my coach’s suggestion, I went to see an Ortho doc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc did an X-Ray, which revealed a hairline fracture. Doctor &lt;em&gt;adviced&lt;/em&gt; bedrest for 3 weeks. Now, from injury to x-ray, I had already done a few training sessions - swim, bike and run. So I knew it was not that bad, but close monitoring was needed. Kaustubh (my coach) asked me to rest and recover, with no workout till event date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also considered dropping from the event. But as all expenses (Event Fee, Hotel, Flight)  were already paid, I decided to still go ahead. If nothing else, I would at least get another open waters swim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached Goa 2 days before the race. Coming from Cold Delhi winters to tropical Goa - it was a big and sudden change in the weather.
Saturday was spent in getting a small practice swim in the sea (scary, 3rd open water swim experience), followed by bike route recee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I chose not to take my cycle, but rent locally. Another experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sat evening was spent organizing my race kit. Took an early dinner, and tried (unsuccessfully) to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Event start time was 8am. I got up at 5:15 am, got ready, and had a light breakfast of omelet and coffee. I always take a light breakfast before the event, it gives stomach some nutrition too, and time to settle down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching the venue, I went directly to the transition area and arranged the stuff as per transition’s order.There was nice cold breeze. But I knew temperature and humidity will rise sharply soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was still nursing an injured knee, race strategy was very conservative - complete swim, try to complete bike, and do not run. The strategy was based on the comparative impact on the knee - swim is easy on the knee, cycling manageable, and run is most brutal on the knee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swim-19km---59min&quot;&gt;Swim [1.9km - 59min]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp at 7:50am, organizers asked us to assemble near swim start point. I did walking meditation, which helped me to be in a calm mindset and not think of sea panic. There were warnings of jellyfishes. On local friends advice, we had applied Vaseline on the body. It apparently reduces the jellyfish sting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swim was a single loop - go straight 900m, turn left and go 100m, come back for 900m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-SwimCourseMap.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Swim Course&quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Swim Course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-SwimCourseMap.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 8:05, flag off was done, we ran towards the sea.
It started smooth. I slowly got into the rhythm, gradually built pace and quickly covered 500m. Suddenly I felt a sharp sting on my left arm. Ah, I was greeted by jellyfish. It was a sharp sting, and pained for a few minutes. I slowed for a bit, but continued to swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I sighted the first 900m buoy. It was closeby. At this part in sea, water suddenly got choppy. Organizers have warned about this stretch. I started to stroke hard to stay afloat. And that is when I got my second jellyfish sting, this time on the right hand. Ah, now this was getting filmy, and I felt like a hero being tested. I actually smiled at my drama loving mind, then moved my arms faster and managed to reach the buoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking left from the buoy, water became smoother. Soon I reached next buoy (100m away) and started the return leg. On the return part, there were no buoy to sight, and shore was too far off. I followed other athletes. And around here, the third jellyfish sting happened. Right wrist this time. This was getting too much to handle. Every time I would look downwards, jellyfishes were swimming. I tried to close my eyes when head in the water, and continued the return leg.&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, I was spared from more attacks, and I soon finished the swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I checked - I ended up swimming 2200mts - full 300mts extra - because of jellyfish distraction and buoys so far off that sighting was a challenge. 300m of extra swim is easily 6-8min wasted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Jellyfish.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1413762389&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t1-7-min&quot;&gt;T1 [7 min]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exiting the sea, I rushed to the medical tent. They were washing stings with vinegar. Lot of other athletes were in worse condition.&lt;br /&gt;
I later discovered everyone got bit by jellyfish, and the average was 3 bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From medical tent, I ran to the transition area to fetch my cycle. As I was already wearing tri-suit, I just wore Heart Rate Monitor, sandals, helmet, gloves and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took about 7” in this transition. This is terribly slow, but in my defense, I was busy cleaning off jellyfish stings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cycle-84km---322hours&quot;&gt;Cycle [84km - 3:22hours]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had gotten hot by this time (9:10am). Immediately on the exit, there was a sharp incline for 0.6km. I walked a bit and then cycled on reaching the main road. I was constantly watching the knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the race, everyone was talking about an athlete Pablo. He was champion of Goa Triathlon for last 5 years and a strong contender for this year too. When I started my first loop, I saw Pablo zipping by. I was wondering was he on his 3rd loop or 4th?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my 2nd loop, I met one participant - Rupesh. He was cycling at a speed similar to mine. I asked him some question about his bike, and then we started to cycle together. From there, till cycle end, we were together - talking about the race, college, and dunno what all stuff. It was his first triathlon, and that too a half iron distance. This sports do draw people with serious grit towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Cycling-3.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every loop, we took hydration breaks. Sun was getting stronger.&lt;br /&gt;
Towards our 5th loop, we saw Pablo, who was now running. We wondered if we’ll finish our cycling or if he will finish his run first. 
Rupesh and I finished cycle around 12:30PM. Knee pain was  manageable. Kaustubh was also cheering and asking about my knee at every possible point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Cycling-1.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/2075344971&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t2-9-min&quot;&gt;T2 [9 min]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching T2, I again saw Pablo - smiling and relaxing. I understood he has finished his half iron. Damn, the dude was crazy fast.
Racking the cycle, I changed into running tee and lied down on grass for a couple of minutes to stretch the back. Rupesh was waiting, i asked him to continue ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-221km---317hours&quot;&gt;Run [22.1km - 3:17hours]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again that steep incline came. My plan was to walk for some time, and if knee is ok, then run. On reaching the top, knee was surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was close to 1pm. The Sun was strong, no trees on the route, temperature was 35 deg. Savage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped at hydration station, got an ice bath. Having cold water on the body felt so good. I felt better, ran a bit faster, soon caught up with Rupesh. From here onwards, we stuck together for the next 16km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Run-2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Caught up Rupesh. Found him chatting with his wife! &quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Run-3.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We faced one more challenge - Ice was available only at the loop end. So 6km stretch with no ice or cold water in between! On every loop, I was doing this - get ice bath, put ice cubes in cap, run fast till body is cold (2km mostly), and then hang on till next ice stop. This continued till 17km, average a slow pace of 8kmph. Weather was absolutely insane by this time - as bad as my half iron experience in Thonnur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Run-10-Water.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Ice PLEASEEEE &quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Run-10-Water.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 17km mark was over, and knee still cooperating, I decided to finish strong. I went ahead from the pack.&lt;br /&gt;
Last 5km came pace was 7:00, 7:39, 7:30, 7:37, 7:48. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;](/images/2019_01_13_GOATRI/GOATRI-Run-5.JPG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last 600mts of downhill were done quickly, I saw the finish line. Kaustubh, as expected, was there - cheering and genuinely happy! I punched in the air, crossed the finish line.
Finally, 4th Half Ironman was done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall time: 7hours 49 min.  This one was special - so much experience and mental victory of scary sea, and bad knee. So much learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-race&quot;&gt;Post-race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day, All Goa Newspapers covered about jellyfish infested sea and the event :). But I’m glad I did this race, fear of jellyfish is gone!
And Pablo got the timing of 4:20hrs. Yes, 4:20! In that heat!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Not To Do List</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/habits/my-not-to-do-list.html"/>
   <updated>2019-01-09T22:15:45+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/habits/my-not-to-do-list</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to-do list. They are powerful and help me get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a few years back, I discovered the power of the &lt;strong&gt;not-to-do&lt;/strong&gt; list. They made such a big impact in my life that I want to share on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of not-do-list is simple: what you don’t do determine what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are few of my not-to-do List
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-no-to-news&quot;&gt;1. No to News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fortunate among us have recognized the hazards of living with an overabundance of food and have started to shift our diets. But most of us do not yet understand that news is to the mind what sugar is to the body.”
-Rolf Dobelli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time when you opened the newspaper and read positive news? Or, even something which helped you make a better decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few of the reasons I do not read news (largely influenced by Robb Dobelli and Nassim Taleb)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. News Mislead us:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
Our brains are wired to pay attention to visible, large, scandalous, sensational, shocking, people-related, story-formatted, fast-changing, loud, graphic onslaughts of stimuli.
&lt;strong&gt;News media outlets, by and large, focus on the highly visible. News grabs our attention; that’s how its business model works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the news, we walk around with the completely wrong risk map in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terrorism is overrated. Chronic stress is underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vijay Mallya scam is overrated. Fiscal subsidies are underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airplane crashes are overrated. Resistance to antibiotics is underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. News makes us dumb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
News has no explanatory power. Will accumulating facts help you understand the world? Sadly, no. The more “news summary” you digest, the less of the big picture you will understand. If information was all we needed, journalists all be billionaires with six-pack abs. That’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. News makes us pessimist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence. That, combined with negative news, provides us a  worldview that is pessimistic, desensitized, and a sense of helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t read the news. I read books and long articles which are organized for me via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedly.com&quot;&gt;feedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-no-to-non-productive-meetings&quot;&gt;2. No to Non-Productive Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the corporate world, Meetings and calls can be very time-consuming. Even more when there is no clear agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every meeting invite, I ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the agenda clear?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I need to attend in person, or I can read summary offline?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the meeting time justifies the agenda?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pausing and reflecting on this has made me escape many time sunk meetings. I am not always successful, but have gone better in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-no-to-phone-notification&quot;&gt;3. No to Phone Notification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having smartphone notification enabled is giving permission to various apps to disturb you as per THEIR convenience. I try to be mindful of this - only Call and Text Message notification are enabled on my phone.
Multitasking is a myth, and cost of context switch due to interruptions is very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-no-to-junk-food&quot;&gt;4. No to Junk Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an active person, with a passion for health and fitness. Fitness without right nutrition is analogous of putting  bad petrol in your Mercedes. &lt;br /&gt;
My rule is simple - Eat Natural, Do not eat what is made in a factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other in my no-to-do list, but these are top 4, which made the most impact.&lt;br /&gt;
And I strongly believe in Pareto Principle - I do not try to be perfect, but as long as I comply to these above rules 80% of the time, I’m on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my not-to-do list. What is yours? &lt;br /&gt;
Let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre Race Details &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/ironman-philippines-june-18-race-diary.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being my first Full Ironman, my race strategy was quite conservative.&lt;br /&gt;
Ironman Philippines is a tough course (it won the award for Asia’s toughest ironman). We knew it would be hot and humid, with 2000m elevation in the bike leg&lt;br /&gt;
Kaustubh (my coach) and I kept on exchanging message on the race and nutrition strategy&lt;br /&gt;
He adviced me to monitor my nutrition very closely. &lt;br /&gt;
Finishing the event was the biggest goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-38km&quot;&gt;Swim [3.8km]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the panic that happened during the practice swim, actual race day swim left like anti-climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a rolling start swim, with a release of a group of 4 athletes for every 6 seconds
Pro Men started at 6:15am followed by Pro Females at 6:20am.&lt;br /&gt;
For Age Groupers, we were divided in 5 Zones, based on our predicted swim timers. First timers were given a separate white cap so we could be spotted and monitored closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly inched closer to the starting mat. I entered water around 6:40am.&lt;br /&gt;
I was warned that swim start would be a chaos, and  it indeed was. There was so much shoving, kicking, jostling. After all 1000+ people were in a very compact area.&lt;br /&gt;
I focused on couting my breath (Allan Pitman gave me this tip during a swim camp I attended). Counting distracts the mind from the chaos, and helps to settle down in a rhythm. This really helped.&lt;br /&gt;
Soon I found a rhythm and started to draft off from one swimmer to another.&lt;br /&gt;
First 1.9k was done in 52min.&lt;br /&gt;
I entered water again, starting second loop. Second loop was much easier, and I managed to finish it in 50min. Right on the predicted timing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;500 600 Survived the swim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 1hr 42min
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/1629696952&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1&quot;&gt;T1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a long transition - 1km from swim exit to cycle starting mat.&lt;br /&gt;
The transition was well organized, no jostling or chaos. I quickly grabbed my bike, took a sip of water, wore helmet, gloves, glasses, sandals and walked towards the start mat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 10min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-180km&quot;&gt;Cycle [180km]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’ve to summarize cycling course of this Ironman in one word, it is “BRUTAL”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course starts easy, first 5km are flat and we move from the city to the expressway. &lt;br /&gt;
But soon we faced the first climb - a grade of ~6% spread over 4km. There were also strong headwinds during that climb. I saw people getting off their TT bike and walk that section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post that climb, it was mostly rolling hills. I stopped at all hydration station, ensuring to re-fuel and get new water bottle. &lt;br /&gt;
First u-turn was at km 50. Now the weather was getting hot. All athletes were taking ice baths at every nutrition stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second U-Turn was at same  place - it was 130km done now. That is where weather took a bad turn. Heavy rain started, making roads very slippery. When the rain stopped, we were hit by strong headwinds. Next 20kms were sheer agony - body is tired, climbs are coming and headwind is relentless. Every pedal stroke was a struggle. I was not alone in this - everyone was slow and hanging on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the time in the race when you enter a dark phase, you just want to stop for a while. I found few other athletes and started chatting with them to distract myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 160km, weather started to improve. Last 5km were all downhill, where I rode quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took almost 8 hours to finish cycling - slower by more than an hour from my worst margins. It was crazy. Thanks to long hours spent in the training, I could finish this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;600 500 Attitude is still thumbs up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 7hr 50min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/1629697285&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-20min&quot;&gt;T2 [20min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of cycling, due to all ice water, heat and sweat, my bum had started to bleed (one boil erupted).&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, I was not carrying any cotton or band-aid. At T2 transition tent, I took towel and tried controlling the blood. Finally, after a very long 10min, blood flow stopped.&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to change to running shorts for comfort. Shorts, Tee, Belt worn - I was off on the road again.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson Learnt - Keep basic first aid kit in Transition bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Time: 20min (Outrageous!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-422km---557hours&quot;&gt;Run [42.2km - 5:57hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running is weakest of my 3 sports. In the training, max run I had done was 25km in one go. So, my debut Ironman was also my debut marathon :-). Hey, I told you it is a crazy story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 5pm when I started to run. I started slow - body was still stiff due to aero riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to cycling, Run also had two loops. Only two half marathons to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the cycling leg, I was calculating race finish time. Original goal of sub 15 hours was long gone. So I had a new target - to get sub 16.&lt;br /&gt;
This gave me about 7hours to finish the run. More than enough, as long as I don’t catch any injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After first 2km, body opened up a bit. First 10km came in 75min.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018_06_03_IMPhi/Race/IM-Run-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;500 600 Pain doesn't mean I won't pose &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;500 600 Pain doesn't mean I won't pose &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I met Vijay(his first ironman too), and we decided to run together. He was struggling a bit - pain in the knee. From Km 10 till Km 35, we ran and walked together, egging each other on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When last 7km remained, I had 40min to get sub 16. This was a pace which I’ve not done even on fresh legs then - and this was after 15hours of fatigue. But I decided to go all out now.&lt;br /&gt;
Those last 7km were so agonizing, but yet so beautiful. I constantly told my mind to shut up. During this last section, I overtook many people.&lt;br /&gt;
As the finish line came closer, I could hear voice of Mike Reilly announcing finishers name. Last few minutes I picked up the pace further, finally sprinting at the red carpet. At the end of red carpet, I jumped and finished it strong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018_06_03_IMPhi/Race/IM-Run-2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;500 600 Finish Line in Sight &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;500 600 Finish Line in Sight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“From India, First time triathlete, Rishi Sareen, you are an Ironman”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018_06_03_IMPhi/Race/Race.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;900 900 Finish Line in Sight &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;900 900 Finish Line in Sight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End time: 15hours 57min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava Link : None, Watch battery died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ironman was done! Exact 2 months before I turned 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-event&quot;&gt;Post event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironman Subic Bay was awarded as Asia’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asiatri.com/2018/12/2018-best-triathlon-races-in-asia/&quot;&gt;toughest race course for 2018!&lt;/a&gt;. To me, this would always remain most special race, the day I kicked off my bucket list in style, and never in those 16 hours, I had a thought to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ironman Philippines - June 18 - Pre Race</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ironman/ironman-philippines-june-18-race-diary.html"/>
   <updated>2019-01-04T05:18:02+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ironman/ironman-philippines-june-18-race-diary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This craze started 2 years back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bucket list&lt;/strong&gt; : a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 2016, during one discussion, I decided I want to do Ironman before my 40th Bday. It was an instant “BucketList++” moment. &lt;br /&gt;
Now one should know that back then I had NO athletic background. &lt;br /&gt;
I didn’t know swimming. &lt;br /&gt;
I had never run more than 7km in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea back then what it is going to take, and how much effort it will ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, I defined the word “beginner”
But then, what is life without a crazy goal or two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a blog post on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/im70-dot-3-journey-the-preparation.html&quot;&gt;2 years back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2018. Somehow I managed to train consistently, even did 3 Half Ironman Distance as preparation for Ironman - from &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/im70-dot-3-dit-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Feb ‘17&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/im70-dot-3-dit-2018-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Feb ‘18&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines Full Ironman event was picked for one simple reason - it was closest to my 40th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anubhav (my training partner) and I had decided to go few days before the event to get some swim experience. Not only we were first timers to Ironman, this was going to be our &lt;em&gt;first ever&lt;/em&gt; sea swim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippines has a very active tri scene. Subic Bay has been hosting IM70.3 distance for many years. This was the first year they were hosting a Full Ironman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was on 3rd June. We reached Subic 4 days before. From Manila Airport to Subic, we could see Ironman Banner all around - from welcoming athletes to mentioning sponsors.
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018_06_03_IMPhi/PreRace/IM-Pre-1-Banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; IM Banner all over the city &quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt; IM Banner all over the city &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Funny story time. As I mentioned, Swim experience was one of the key reason why we reached 4 days before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race Organizers had opened the swim route for practice from Thursday, 31st May. &lt;br /&gt;
The practice course was simple - swim straight line for 500mts to a boat, and come back. There were Kayak to spot and help. Many first timers were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anubhav and I reached the swim spot in afternoon. It was a beautiful day - calm sea, and crystal clear water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had borrowed a Garmin Tri watch from a friend. While I was figuring out how to switch it on, I saw Anubhav had already started to swim. This guy was cool as a cucumber!&lt;br /&gt;
By the time watch latched GPS signal, Anubhav and spotting Kayak were already 100m away in the water!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing alone on the beach did nothing to ease my inner panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gathering courage, I started to swim on my own. It was smooth for first 50m. Suddenly sea floor dipped. Remember I said - crystal clear water? I could suddenly see that bottom of sea is far away.&lt;br /&gt;
Mind quickly declared: “Panic, you are so going to die”. I started to hyper ventilate and quickly turned back and swam / thrashed in the water till my feet could touch the ocean floor again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing back on the shore, I weighed my option. I didn’t want to continue the swim. But I also knew that if I went back today without swimming, fear would be 10x amplified next time. I as well as declare my race to be over even before starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took few deep breaths, gathered courage from somewhere and started to swim again. I focused on slow swim, taking nice deep breaths. I crossed same 50m spot. Heart rate got raised, but I continued. Soon my watch buzzed - 100m. I paused a bit here, letting Heart Rate settle down and contiuned. At 150m mark, I decided to turn back. Return was easy, I reached back shore grinning.&lt;br /&gt;
The mental barrier was broken - I DID IT!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did went back next 2 days also for practice - did 1k each time. The swim challenge was handled now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next few days were spent going to Ironman Expo, getting race kit, acclimatization to the heat.&lt;br /&gt;
We had a chance to meet a lot of seasoned athletes. Everyone was remarking how this is one of the toughest course. Those who had done Kona (Ironman World Championship venue, and one of the toughest course) compared this route to Kona! &lt;em&gt;Gasp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>My 2018 Annual Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/annualreview/my-2018-annual-review.html"/>
   <updated>2019-01-03T09:21:38+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/annualreview/my-2018-annual-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year I’m writing my first Annual Review. The purpose of this yearly report is to reflect back on the last year, and to write an honest review of what went well, what could have gone better, and what I’m working towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing my annual Goal Setting and Review for 4 years now, and this is my first time doing a public annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 questions that I’m going to answer in my Annual Review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What went well this year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What didn’t go so well this year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What am I working toward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was an awesome year, with many achievements, but few stumbles too.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s get on with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-what-went-well-this-year&quot;&gt;1. What went well this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health/Sports:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a very good year in my Health and Sports pursuit. Major Achievements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full Ironman (3.8km swim, 180k bike, 42.2km run) Completed successfully - Philippines, 3rd June&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/ironman/im70-dot-3-dit-2018-race-report.html&quot;&gt;Half Ironman&lt;/a&gt; done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Half Marathons completed, with Sub 2 timing achieved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportstimingsolutions.in/share/83F04C639426293CAF01.html&quot;&gt;1:59 Finish time&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m obviously very happy about these milestones. But even more than that, I’m happy that I was very consistent with my workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BsLFdUQgt48/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&quot;&gt;230 days and 432 hours of training&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Swim : 46h and 103.5km&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bike : 167h and 3931km&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Run : 169h and 1305km run.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strength and Flexibility Training: 49h&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 was the year where I learned swimming, 2018 was the year where I got decent in running. 2019 is the year of big gains in cycling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning New Stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; This year, most of my learning was done via Podcast medium. Though most of it was in the space of Triathlon (Science &amp;amp; Practical Training Ideas), there were other learning gems too - Tim Ferriss, Ben Greenfield Fitness, The Joe Rogan Experience. I even wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/podcasts/my-top-5-podcasts.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about my top podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt; Travel is both in “what went well”, and “need more”. After Ironman, I took few days off to roam in the Philippines, which was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Office:** Fantastic year, worked on a new product and new role and enjoyed engaging with different regional teams. It is so good when you’ve an awesome bunch of team members to work with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-what-didnt-go-so-well-this-year&quot;&gt;2. What didn’t go so well this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt; I really wanted to make Meditation as a regular habit in 2018. I did try multiple experiments, and even managed to do 200 sessions last year. But those were low-quality sessions, and Meditation as a habit is not yet formed. I have my takeaways on why it failed as habit Forming (no consistent timing of habit), and I’ll make myself better in this in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing:&lt;/strong&gt;  I want to be more regular in writing. Two main reasons - writing is a good way to clear the mind, and I also want to share my learnings with like-minded folks. I did not meet my the last year goals on Writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt; Can travel be enough? I guess not. I wanted to do a solo trek, and one with friends - didn’t yet happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-what-am-i-working-towards&quot;&gt;3. What am I working towards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit Forming:&lt;/strong&gt; If I’m obsessed with anything more than my sports, it is the superpower of Habits, and Science behind Habit forming. I’ve experimented on this a lot in last few years, and it will continue in 2019 too. Right habits are shortcuts to achieve other goals; will power is so overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports, particularly Triathlon, have been one of the changing moments of my life. By now, Sports is more or less an integral part of my life in a friction-free way. This year focus would be to continue to build on the gains, and do 2 Full Ironmans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Importance of Sleep is difficult to overstate. I’m not talking just about the number of hours, but the overall quality of sleep. This is an area I’ve stil not completely mastered, and experiements will continue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow More, Contribute More:&lt;/strong&gt; All my life, I’ve been obsessed with on consuming knowledge. Now I want to build things - via writing, building plans for friends for sports/health pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost all successful people rave about Meditation as one of their superpower. My experiments will continue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Writing:&lt;/strong&gt; Atleast one post a week, 52 posts a year. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue eliminate the non-essential:&lt;/strong&gt; To say yes to all the stuff, I’ve to ruthlessly &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/habits/my-not-to-do-list.html&quot;&gt;eliminate the inessential.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is short, and not to be wasted randomly. I’m on the journey to explore, experiment, and discover more about myself in the process. There are so many areas of my life that can use some improvement. But the only way to influence future is do what I can do, now.&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers to a happy and progressive new year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five podcasts I love listening to</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/podcasts/my-top-5-podcasts.html"/>
   <updated>2018-11-18T11:48:34+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/podcasts/my-top-5-podcasts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those who are not aware, Podcasts are episodes of a program available on the Internet. They are similar to radio program, but they are audio files, and one can downlad and listen to them at their convenience. iOS and Android devices have podcast apps available for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For podcast listeners, podcasts are a way to enjoy great content from around the world for free. For podcast publishers, podcasts are a great way to reach a wide audience.
One can find podcasts for broad ranging topics - business, startup, sports, health, self-development, culture, history, …the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hooked on Podcasts for half a decade now. After books, this is my most preferred medium to acquire knowledge on any topic. 
I usually listen to podcast during my commute - 1:5 hours of total commute gives enough time to listen to one episode, and get some good knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of my top 5 favorite podcasts: 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/podcast/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tim Ferris Show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: For anyone who is into life hacking, Tim Ferriss is THE GURU. The Tim Ferriss Show is generally the #1 business podcast on all of Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the Tim’s description about his podcast:&lt;br /&gt;
 “Each episode, I deconstruct world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, sports, business, art, etc.) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use.  This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each episode varies from 45” to 2hours sometime. Tim is a master interviewer, and though interviews are of long duration, they are value for the time. I’ve listened to almost 200 podcasts from Tim, some of them multiple times. I can’t recommend this guy enough. If you listen to just one podcast, listen to Tim.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Particulary the episides with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Scott Adams, Tony Robbins, Peter Thiel were very good. I’ve learnt so many things from the guests on the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After listening to Terry Laughlin’s podcast on Tim’s Show, I implemented his techniques, and learnt swimming (&lt;strong&gt;at age 38!!!&lt;/strong&gt;). And that is just one example! Go, listen now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.joerogan.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; : Second to Tim, Joe is another master interviewer and does the long format interview. He was a standup comedian, MMA expert. His interview list is again wide ranging - comedians, actors, MMA fighters, authors and more. His interview with Wim Hoff and Sam Harris were particularly brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://purplepatchfitness.com/education/podcasts&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Patch Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This podcast is mostly geared towards triathlon, though his episodes on nutrition and hydration are useful to anyone who is active in sports. 
Matt Dixon has coached more podium finisher triathletes than any other coach. He has a no-nonsense, cut to the chase approach to the triathlon training. Each single episode is just outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Greenfield Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Ben Greenfield is the ultimate biohacker. His website says: “In 2013 and 2014, Ben was named as one of the world’s top 100 most influential people in health and fitness, and by 2015, Ben was coaching the world’s top CEO’s, chefs, biohackers, poker players, tennis, motocross and endurance competitors, and professional athletes from the UFC, the NHL, the NBA, the NFL and beyond – all while advising and investing in top companies in the health, fitness and nutrition industry.”. Ben is a treasure hove for anyone who wants to get a bit more fit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://primalendurance.libsyn.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primal Endurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This is hosted by Brad Kearns - another top former athlete. This podcast focus on healthy eating, rest, recovery. Most of my nutrition philosophy comes from Primal Endurance. Very logical, very strightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast world, just like the book world, is a very vast world. Internet has completely changed the content creation, and many leaders are using blogs and podcast method to reach out to audience and like minded people. The above list is from my favorite genre - Lifestyle management, and fitness. Hopefully this will give you some pointers to dip your toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Book Review - Essentialism - by Greg McKeown</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/books/book-review-essentialism-by-greg-mckeown.html"/>
   <updated>2018-11-10T23:05:36+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/books/book-review-essentialism-by-greg-mckeown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;book-details&quot;&gt;Book Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read on : 2018-01-02&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rating : 7/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382&quot;&gt;Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg McKeown defines Essentialism as “Less but better”.  The key takeaway is that only once you give yourself the permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a well organized book, divided in four main parts. The first part establishes the need and mindset of an Essentialist. The second part delves into how to distinguish trivial from the essential. The third part then takes us through the strategies to cut out the trivial, and the final part discuss practical aspects on how to make the essential work an effortless work. The structure of the book is well thought of, and each part builds on the previous one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1--essence&quot;&gt;Part 1 : Essence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.” 
This part discuss about the need and mindset of an Essentialist, and why we need to pursue this.  Three main reasons why we need a disciplined and mindful pursuit of Essentialism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TOO MANY CHOICES. We have all observed the exponential increase in choices over the last decade. Yet even in the midst of it, and perhaps because of it, we have lost sight of the most important ones. As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.”
We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what isn’t. Psychologists call this “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TOO MUCH SOCIAL PRESSURE It is not just the number of choices that has increased exponentially, it is also the strength and number of outside influences on our decisions that has increased. While much has been said and written about how hyperconnected we now are and how distracting this information overload can be, the larger issue is how our connectedness has increased the strength of social pressure. Today, technology has lowered the barrier for others to share their opinion about what we should be focusing on. It is not just information overload; it is opinion overload.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THE IDEA THAT “YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL” The idea that we can have it all and do it all is not new. This myth has been peddled for so long, I believe virtually everyone alive today is infected with it. It is sold in advertising. It is championed in corporations. It is embedded in job descriptions that provide huge lists of required skills and experience as standard. It is embedded in university applications that require dozens of extracurricular activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an Australian nurse named Bronnie Ware, who cared for people in the last twelve weeks of their lives, recorded their most often discussed regrets. At the top of the list: &lt;strong&gt;“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”&lt;/strong&gt;
To harness the courage we need to get on the right path, it pays to reflect on how short life really is and what we want to accomplish in the little time we have left. As poet Mary Oliver wrote: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2--explore&quot;&gt;Part 2 : Explore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Explore, Greg delves into strategies on how to distinguish noise/non-essential from the essential. Main argument is we need to pause, allow ourselves some time to think and decide. React, not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Escape : In order to have focus we need to escape to focus. This is very true in corporate life too. Everyone is too busy to even pause and think on what is the strategic area. The speed at which we are running doesn’t matter much, if the direction is not correct. Still how many people dare to escape to focus on the essential.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look :- See what Matters :  In the chaos of the modern workplace, with so many loud voices all around us pulling us in many directions, it is more important now than ever that we learn to resist the siren song of distraction and keep our eyes and ears peeled for the headlines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play :  The value of play in our lives can’t be overstated. Studies from the animal kingdom reveal that play is so crucial to the development of key cognitive skills it may even play a role in a species’ survival. Bob Fagan, a researcher who has spent fifteen years studying the behavior of grizzly bears, discovered bears who played the most tended to survive the longest. When asked why, he said, “In a world continuously presenting unique challenges and ambiguity, play prepares these bears for a changing planet.  Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain. You know how it feels: you’re stressed about work and suddenly everything starts going wrong. You can’t find your keys, you bump into things more easily, you forget the critical report on the kitchen table. Recent findings suggest this is because stress increases the activity in the part of the brain that monitors emotions (the amygdala), while reducing the activity in the part responsible for cognitive function (the hippocampus)7—the result being, simply, that we really can’t think clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleep :  Protecting the Asset The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. One of the most common ways people—especially ambitious, successful people—damage this asset is through a lack of sleep. If we let our type A instincts take over, we will, like Geoff, be swallowed up whole. We will burn out too early. We need to be as strategic with ourselves as we are with our careers and our businesses. We need to pace ourselves, nurture ourselves, and give ourselves fuel to explore, thrive, and perform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select :  In a piece called “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,” the popular TED speaker Derek Sivers describes a simple technique for becoming more selective in the choices we make. The key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes, Derek-style. Anything less gets a thumbs down. If we search for “a good career opportunity,” our brain will serve up scores of pages to explore and work through. Instead, why not conduct an advanced search and ask three questions: “What am I deeply passionate about?” and “What taps my talent?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” Naturally there won’t be as many pages to view, but that is the point of the exercise. We aren’t looking for a plethora of good things to do. We are looking for the one where we can make our absolutely highest point of contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-3-eliminate&quot;&gt;Part 3: Eliminate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous parts author makes the case for why essentialism is needed, and how to identify what is essential and what is not. In this part, strategies on how to cut down on the non-essential. I particularly liked the emotional aspects of saying no, as we humans are hard-wired to strive in a society, and saying no is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the discipline to say no to opportunities—often very good opportunities—that come your way in work and life is infinitely harder than throwing out old clothes in your closet. But find it you must, because remember that anytime you fail to say “no” to a nonessential, you are really saying yes by default. So once you have sufficiently explored your options, the question you should be asking yourself is not: “What, of my list of competing priorities, should I say yes to?” Instead, ask the essential question: “What will I say no to?” This is the question that will uncover your true priorities. It is the question that will reveal the best path forward for your team. It is the question that will uncover your true purpose and help you make the highest level of contribution not only to your own goals but to the mission of your organization. It is that question that can deliver the rare and precious clarity necessary to achieve game-changing breakthroughs in your career, and in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarify :  When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive.  I have noticed two common patterns that typically emerge when teams lack clarity of purpose. PATTERN 1: PLAYING POLITICS In the first pattern, the team becomes overly focused on winning the attention of the manager. The problem is, when people don’t know what the end game is, they are unclear about how to win, and as a result they make up their own game and their own rules as they vie for the manager’s favor. Instead of focusing their time and energies on making a high level of contribution, they put all their effort into games like attempting to look better than their peers, demonstrating their self-importance, and echoing their manager’s every idea or sentiment. These kinds of activities are not only nonessential but damaging and counterproductive. We do a similar thing in our personal lives as well. When we are unclear about our real purpose in life—in other words, when we don’t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values—we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look good in comparison to other people. We overvalue nonessentials like a nicer car or house, or even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter or the way we look in our Facebook photos. As a result, we neglect activities that are truly essential, like spending time with our loved ones, or nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dare to say no : Saying no is not easy -  We can’t bear the thought of disappointing someone we respect and like. None of this makes us a bad person. It’s a natural part of being human. Yet as hard as it can be to say no to someone, failing to do so can cause us to miss out on something far more important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit :
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Editing aids the effortless execution of the Essentialist by removing anything distracting or unnecessary or awkward. Or, as one book editor put it: “My job is to make life as effortless as possible for the reader. The goal is to help the reader have the clearest possible understanding of the most important message or takeaway.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When making decisions, deciding to cut options can be terrifying—but the truth is, it is the very essence of decision making.In fact: The Latin root of the word decision—cis or cid—literally means “to cut” or “to kill.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit - Setting the Boundary :  Nonessentialists tend to think of boundaries as constraints or limits, things that get in the way of their hyperproductive life. To a Nonessentialist, setting boundaries is evidence of weakness. If they are strong enough, they think, they don’t need boundaries. They can cope with it all. They can do it all. But without limits, they eventually become spread so thin that getting anything done becomes virtually impossible. Essentialists, on the other hand, see boundaries as empowering. They recognize that boundaries protect their time from being hijacked and often free them from the burden of having to say no to things that further others’ objectives instead of their own. They know that clear boundaries allow them to proactively eliminate the demands and encumbrances from others that distract them from the true essentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4--execute&quot;&gt;Part 4 : Execute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when we’ve identified what is essential, eliminated the non-essential, this final part goes into how to make it work. This part is mainly focussed on productivity tips on how to get essential work done with the highest quality. This part is cumilation of many productity books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buffer - The unfair advantage:  A “buffer” can be defined literally as something that prevents two things from coming into contact and harming each other.  These days the pace of our lives is only getting faster and faster.  As a result, execution is often highly stressful, frustrating, and forced.    Here are a few tips for keeping your work—and sanity—from swerving off the road by creating a buffer.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use Extreme Preparedness.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add 50% to your time estimate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subtract things every day:  Instead of focusing on the efforts and resources we need to add, the Essentialist focuses on the constraints or obstacles we need to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress - The power of small win -  The key is to start small, encourage progress, and celebrate small wins. Some tips
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do the Minimal Viable Preparation every day&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Visually reward progress&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow - The genius of routine -  What we can’t do is concentrate on two things at the same time. When I talk about being present, I’m not talking about doing only one thing at a time. I’m talking about being focused on one thing at a time. Multitasking itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can “multifocus” is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be - The Essentialist Life :  MORE JOY IN THE JOURNEY With the focus on what is truly important right now comes the ability to live life more fully, in the moment. For me, a key benefit of being more present in the moment has been making joyful memories that would otherwise not exist. I smile more. I value simplicity. I am more joyful. As the Dalai Lama, another true Essentialist, has said: “If one’s life is simple, contentment has to come. Simplicity is extremely important for happiness.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Airtel Delhi Half Marathon(ADHM)-2018 Race Report</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/airteldelhihalfmarathon-2018-race-report.html"/>
   <updated>2018-10-29T00:04:46+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/airteldelhihalfmarathon-2018-race-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-race&quot;&gt;The Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtel Delhi Half Marathon (ADHM) is one of the most prestigious races in Delhi. Top athletes from all over the world take part in it. I was taking part in this for the first time. It is strange, anyone in NCR who is even moderately active runs ADHM every year. Well, I did register for this race in 2016 and 2017, but somehow couldn’t take part. That made me even more determined to do well in this race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-preparation&quot;&gt;The Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been a runner. In fact, till June 2016, max distance I ran was 7km (Great Delhi Run). I’ve slowly worked on building my speed and endurance. As Triathlon is my sports of choice, there is no option but to improve in running. 
Since last one year, I’ve been training using &lt;a href=&quot;https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/&quot;&gt;MAF/HR based approach&lt;/a&gt;. That topic in itself is big enough to warrant a separate post. But main points - a) Slow running, get more aerobically fit, and b) Low Carb, High Fat, to burn fat as fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ADHM, I started focussed training from Aug ‘18, under the guidance of my coach Kaustubh Radkar. The program was simple - Good base building with MAF principle, with one-speed work per week. 
My previous best in HM was 2 hours 26min (Amritsar, Feb ’18), and I wanted to improve significantly from that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training went good in August and September. But then, what is a journey without a twist or two. Few weeks before the race, I caught a nasty viral and was bed ridden for a week. That gave a setback in the training. And, once I recovered, I was silly enough to donate blood. Now, don’t get me wrong - blood donation is a noble endeavor, and I’ve been doing this regularly for years now. But doing this close to the event, and especially when the body has not recovered caused a sharp drop in my aerobic capacity. I read about this later - when we donate blood, Red Blood Cells are reduced in the body. These cells are responsible for transporting oxygen in the body. So, it directly impacts running fitness, and it takes 3-4 weeks to come to a normal level. Damn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was too late to repent. We discussed and re-adjusted our training focus - most of it was slow long distance running. Trust the process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;race-countdown--strategy&quot;&gt;Race Countdown &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taper started a week before the race, with mileage decreased, and last 2 days were no workout. I strictly followed the taper, and nicely did overeating :-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening before the race, Kaustubh and I had a chat on the race strategy. I was thinking of pushing for a sub-2 finish. But he advised not to push, as I had not trained for this during my workouts. So, we agreed that I’ll take the first 5km at 6-6:15 pace, and then either hold it or slow accelerate based on how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before, I went through my pre-race checklist. Laid down everything, so no morning panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;race-day&quot;&gt;Race Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race was to start at 5 am. So, I got up at 3 am, freshened up, made a 2 eggs omelet, dressed up and left. I decided not to take the car to avoid parking chaos. ADHM is a big race, with 350,000 participants. It was going to be crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the venue at 4:15 am, met brother there. He is a fantastic runner but had been dormant for 2 years. Still,  ADHM is ADHM - this is a race which is to be run!
I was in section C, slowly started moving towards the race start gate. The crowd was massive! Soon, the race gate came into sight. I re-checked my Garmin to ensure it is on and latched to the GPS. At exact 5:04, I crossed the start mat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start to 5km: The atmosphere on the race line was electrifying. 35,000 people were running, and it showed! I slowly made my way in between crowd. My first km was slowest - 6:30. Weather was nice, the ill-fame Delhi Pollution was subdued. It was a strange feel - to run in the dark with so many people around. Next few kms followed quickly, with a pace of 6:18, 6:20, 5:54, 6:00. HR was a very steady 147bpm, and I was glad to see that. 
Km 5 to km 15 :  By now, I had settled down on a nice rhythm - Cadence was a steady 166, HR was also steady. Post 5km, as the crowd thinned, I focused on slow acceleration.  My next 10 km went 6:05, 5:59, 6:15, 5:47, 5:46, 5:49,5:50,5:36,5:45, 5:39. I finished 15km in the exact target of 1:30. Cadence slowly moved up to 169bpm. HR at end of 15km was 159bpm, which was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Km 15 to Km 21.1: This was the time for calculation - last 6km to go, and 30min remaining for sub 2. Theoretically, it was in my reach, but it would have required acceleration beyond what I had done in the training. So I took the call of not going it this time but just enjoy a nice strong finish. I slowly accelerated, and last 6km came in 34min (5:34, 5:45, 5:33, 5:35, 5:21, 5:26). Close to finish line, I saw another runner going strong. I greeted him, only to discover he was my college mate - Bikram! What are the chances!! I sprinted on seeing the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Time: 2:04:11. Pace: 5:51mn/km. Average HR: 154, Av Cadence: 169&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was feeling so strong, hardly any fatigue and HR very quickly came down to sub 100bpm. Loved this race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-thoughts&quot;&gt;Post Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MAF training works!!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Race organization was just ok, even disappointing for such a big race. Volunteers at aid stations were half sleepy, and not proactive in handling out nutrition quickly. I expected better than this from such a popular A-race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my 3rd Half Ironman distance. 
I’ve raced this route last year, so I knew what to expect from the route and logistics (parking, transition zones etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIB Collection was planned for 16th and 17th Feb. I wanted to keep 17th Feb completely free, so collected the BIB on 16th evening itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon was spent organizing my race kit. I opened my phone, launched google tasks app where I’ve saved my Ironman Checklist. 
I organized stuff into 4 piles, as per the race transition - Pre-Swim stuff, T1 (Swim-&amp;gt;Bike transition), T2 (Bike-&amp;gt;Run), and post-event change of clothes. 
Once done, I packed everything in the car. I didn’t leave any packing for the morning. This gives me a peace of mind. Mentally settled, I went to bed around 10:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 18th Feb, was the event day. This year start was at 5 am, an hour earlier than last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up at 3:15 am. Got ready, had water and banana, and left for the venue.
Reaching Venue, I went directly to the transition area and laid down the stuff. The weather was nice. I knew it will get hot by the time run will start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, Office work had been very hectic, and I didn’t get much time to train. This was my most under-prepared race.&lt;br /&gt;
To give an idea of under-training - From Oct to Feb, I got only 3 swimming sessions, and 6-7 bike rides. Running was the only aspect on which I’ve worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to play conservative, and re-use goals from last year - 60 min swim, 3:30 hr Bike, 2:30 hr Run, and 10 min of each transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-19km---59min&quot;&gt;Swim [1.9km - 59min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swim was in SPM Indoor pool, 38 laps of the 50mts pool. I was assigned Pool2, Lane1 - sharing with 4 other athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim started at 5 am, my name was called out at 5:05 am. I ran to the pool, saw 2 other athletes jumping in the pool. 
I paused for 30 seconds, let some distance come between me and other two, and slowly started to swim.
Water temperature was nice, the pool was familiar. I tried bilateral breathing but didn’t feel relaxed with it, so decided to stick to right side breathing. 
I slowly picked the pace, overtook each athlete one by one. 
The swim was easy, nothing remarkable - I swam comfortably, and didn’t push much (none in fact). I finished it in an hour and came out of the pool at 6:05 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1413762389&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-7-min&quot;&gt;T1 [7 min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, my exit from the pool was a clumsy effort. This year, thankfully it was smooth. I quickly came out, ran to the transition area. The floor was wet, and I almost slipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my clothes lined up. I grabbed the towel, quickly dried myself, wore cycling shorts, tee, jacket, and socks. As with all my previous events, I was going to cycle in sandals. 
In my past races, I’ve realized that as the time is limited, rinsing head quickly doesn’t dry it completely, and the combination of damp hair and morning wind on the bike would make me sneeze. So this time I chose to wear my wool buff as the head scarf. A good decision!! We live and learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took about 7” in this transition. Little better than last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-90km---336hours&quot;&gt;Cycle [90km - 3:36hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cycling, it was 10 loops of 9.4km each. There was a timing mat to count all the loops. But everyone was responsible to keep a mental count of the loop - it is not so easy when the mind is getting foggy due to tiredness. 
This time there was no u-turn in the route, which was supposed to help with the speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still dark when I started to cycle (around 6:20 am). The weather was comfortable. 
Immediately after the loop start, there was a steep incline of 250mts - brutal, brutal!! Legs slowly opened up, and I maintained a steady pace of 25kmph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in the 3rd loop, a funny incident happened. I was on that incline leg, huffing and puffing through my way. Suddenly a group of cyclist overtook me, and then few more did that. They all looked so fresh. I was taken aback for a minute - I knew I was under-trained for the cycling, but not this bad that people would overtake me left, right and center. Then I saw their event tag and realized they were Olympics event participants, and have started bike leg just now! I grinned at myself on my internal panic and cycled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During all this, I was constantly on the lookout for Anubhav. Anubhav and I have been practicing together. He is still working on his swim, and a very strong cyclist and runner. He caught up with me during the 5th loop (He was 10’ behind in the swim leg). We both took our first break at 50km mark. I had an energy drink, banana and started to pedal again. 
Last 4 loops were a struggle, lack of practice was showing. Though I was trying to push hard, I couldn’t generate much power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my cycle close to 9:50 AM. When I was entering the stadium towards T2, I saw Anubhav in his running gear, about to start the run. I mentally calculated, he was about 5’ ahead now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My total bike time was 3:38, 10” more than my last time. I was disappointed, but I pushed if off from my mind - this was not the time to analyze. I had to focus on the run segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1412990584&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-6-min&quot;&gt;T2 [#6 min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a simple transition - remove gloves, sandals, helmet, wear running shoes, iPhone armband, eat a banana, and off I went. It was calm, and yet efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-211km---236hours&quot;&gt;Run [#21.1km - 2:36hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past months, my main effort has gone in running. I’ve been training with MAF method, which emphasis on the long slow run, close to your aerobic max heart rate. This not only increases the aerobic capacity but also adapts your body to burn fat as the preferred fuel. I’ve lost a lot of inches from tummy, without even trying And I was getting faster, so I knew this was working.
My aerobic threshold is 141bpm. For this race, I’ve set the target of running &amp;lt;160bpm for the first 10km, &amp;lt;165bpm for next 5, and all out for the remaining 5km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was close to 10 am when I started to run. Legs were stiff in the first 3km, but then I expected this from the past experience. After 3km, legs opened up nicely. Run was good, consistent run, with less walking breaks. Luckily, I could execute it almost as planned - I ran good, felt comfortable, and was able to increase my pace during the last 5km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished run leg in 2 hours 36min, which is 20 minutes improvement over my run from the last year. I was happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, 3rd Half Ironman was done! Last one before I go for Full Ironman, on 3rd June
Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/1413129449/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall time: 7hours 26 min.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Aa dekhe jara, kis mein kitna hai dum”&lt;/em&gt;
The alarm, with this song as its alarm tone, went off at 4 am, and I was up immediately. “Song is really apt!”, I pondered!
The event was going to start at 6 am, and I wanted to reach by 5 am.
My mind was surprisingly calm. I had packed everything last night, so there was no last-minute anxiety.
I quickly ate one banana and stepped out in the wee hours of a cold winter morning. Six months of training - of learning how to swim, running more than 7k,….today was THE DAY I have been waiting for.
Reaching the venue, I went directly to check my cycle. Everything was just as I had kept the last evening. The weather was cool and pleasant, with the Delhi winter receding. It looked like a good day to crack Half Ironman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-strategy&quot;&gt;Race Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being my first triathlon, my race strategy was quite conservative. I wanted to enjoy the event, and not walk through the run segment. Run is my weakest of 3 sports. I had planned to do 60min swim, 3:30hr ride, 2:30hr run, and 10 min of each transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-19km---59min&quot;&gt;Swim [1.9km - 59min]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim was at Talkatora in an indoor heated pool stadium. In there were 3 swimming pools, each 50m long and having 10 lanes. Our event was scheduled to be in pool no. 2
For half ironman distance, there were a total of 19 laps, back and forth, in the 50m pool length. It was a staggered start. We were assigned lanes, as per the self-predicted completion time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 5:55 am, Sangeeta Saika, the swim race director, started calling one by one, and assigned lanes.
As name call continued, my heart started beating fast. The feeling of being part of the event was sinking in! Damn! All those months of preparation and D-Day already came!
I soon heard “Rishi Sareen, Lane 5”. I waved at the announcer, crossed the timing mat, and entered lane 5. Two people were already in this lane.
As soon as I entered the pool, I focused on proper breathing to relax and concentrated on taking good strokes. I had learned swimming just a few months back, and I wanted to take it easy and be comfortable.
After 2-3 laps, I overtook other people (there were a total of 6 people now in my lane) and retained this lead throughout the swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out from the pool at 7:01 am, about 5-10min slower than my best effort. But it was a good swim.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/871674073&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-10min&quot;&gt;T1 [10min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something funny happened when I was exiting the pool. Entry &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; to the pool is simple - you just jump in. But, when you’ve to come out, there are no ladders, one is supposed to hoist himself up. I’ve seen athletes do this very gracefully, using their arm strength. Now, I’ve never practiced this. So, I ended up doing a very confused mix of partial pulling by arm strength, and partial throwing my leg up and hanging on to my dear life!
When I came out from the pool, organizers clapped and cheered for me. I feel they were secretly relieved that I didn’t just drown during exit! Anyway, I acted all serious, business-like (hey, the camera was around), and rushed towards transition area where I’ve kept my change of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my towel, rinsed hair, changed to cycling attire, shoes, ate a bar of snickers, and off I went.
I took about 10” for all this. Not fast, not slow, it went as per the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cycle-90km---326hours&quot;&gt;Cycle [90km - 3:26hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cycling, it was 9 loops of 10km each. There was a timing mat which was counting all loops.
For cycling, there were two main factors bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First of all, the fear of puncture. I had learned to fix a puncture on Roadie only last evening, and I was not sure how much time I’d take in the event if this happened.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second factor was the route. This triathlon happens in heart of Central Delhi, and it gets a lot of traffic, which can really put a break on the speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to see what happens on the course. I moved towards the Starting Mat. Here I could hear a lot of cheering. It was all participating crowd and families who came to cheer.
I glanced at my watch - 7:10 AM. The weather was nice.
I started and then maintained a steady pace of 25kmph. I kept on sipping water every 25min and ate a bar of snickers every 40min.
I eased out my cycling effort in the last 10km, as suggested by coach. This was to get heart rate low and keep energy for the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling was uneventful - training on these roads during last few weeks helped a lot. And hats off to the organizers and Delhi Police - they managed traffic so well. It was as smooth as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finished cycling, it was a sigh of relief in my mind - “Look Maa, no puncture!”.
Time: 3:26 hours
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/871526263&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-10min&quot;&gt;T2 [#10min]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of cycling, I was wondering whether to run in cycling shorts or change to running shorts. Finally, I decided to change - running is my weakest of all 3 sports, and I didn’t want to experiment with cycling shorts at the last minute. Good decision! I quickly changed to running shorts, ate another banana and ran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-211km---258hours&quot;&gt;Run [#21.1km - 2:58hours]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 10:47 AM by the time I started my run. Sun was out, and it was turning out to be a hot day. This time it was a loop of 10km, so 2 loops, and then 1km inside the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a slow run, and immediately felt a pain in right knee. It persisted for 2km, and then it got better. I met few folks from Nasik and Mumbai, who had done short distance triathlon earlier but were attempting first Half Ironman distance. And here I was - attempting my first ever triathlon, that too a Half Ironman distance. I don’t know if I was braver or more foolish :). But as the saying goes - “Stay hungry, stay foolish”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running was a pain, it went slow. I grabbed water at every aid station, ran and walked. We had formed a group of 4 people, some guys from Maharashtra and myself. We all were getting tired, and egging each other on. Towards the last 5km, Nasik guy was getting too tired. So, I paced him. It was a little surreal - me pacing someone. But we had stuck around each other for almost entire 10km, and I was not going to leave them hanging at last sprint.
Towards the last 1k, my friend Anubhav came over to pace me. I gathered final burst of energy, and finished it!
It was a bad run, but I was glad for it to be over! Lot of learning, and lot of positive takeaways!
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/871601691&quot;&gt;Strava Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Half Ironman was done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall time: 7hours 45 min.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>IM70.3 Journey - The Preparation</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ironman/im70-dot-3-journey-the-preparation.html"/>
   <updated>2017-04-12T05:18:02+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ironman/im70-dot-3-journey-the-preparation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-tried---the-background-story&quot;&gt;Why I Tri’ed - The Background story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the word “impossible”. Hate it, hate it, hate it! &lt;br /&gt;
Hold on, I love this word. It is actually very motivating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was summer of 2016. Anubhav and I were catching up in our office’s breakout area, discussing upcoming sports events. He mentioned two events in particular - Delhi -&amp;gt; Mumbai cycling event (1500kms over 5 days, planned in Dec 16), and a Triathlon planned in Feb 2017.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started Riding regularly, and Delhi-&amp;gt;Mumbai cycling sounded fascinating. And Triathlon - it was always enthralling thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to my desk, checked out event details. There was Duathon(Ride + Run), and Triathlon(Swim, Ride, Run) 
For Triathlon, 3 categories were available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprint Distance&lt;/strong&gt;   : Swim  750m (Cut off 50mins)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 20Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 5 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 3hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olympic Distance&lt;/strong&gt;  : Swim 1500m (Cut off 1:20hrs)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 40Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 10 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 5hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HalfIron Distance&lt;/strong&gt; : Swim 1900m (Cut off 1:30hrs)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ride : 90Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Run : 21 Kms&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total Cutoff Time: 8.5hours&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused, wrote down my current capability list. It read like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim&lt;/strong&gt;  : Can float, can’t breathe while swimming. Rating: 2/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run&lt;/strong&gt;   : Max distance in one go: 7km. Rating: 3/10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ride&lt;/strong&gt; : This was good. I had done multiple century rides. So was not a beginner. Rating: 5/10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had to decide the event to enroll. Duathlon was never in consideration for me, it had to be triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accessed all the factors carefully - my current capability, magnitude of challenge in hand, limited time with the Job, personal time and Commitments. After weighing all these carefully, I &lt;strong&gt;“wisely”&lt;/strong&gt; went ahead and signed for the biggest badass event - Half Ironman distance!! I guess it just ticked my flag of &lt;strong&gt;“is this crazy enough”&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
I signed up on 7/May/2016 for this. Event date was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;19 Feb 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-planning&quot;&gt;The Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had three monsters to slay - Learn Swimming, Learn Running and improve Cycling conditioning so I can run post cycling.  &lt;br /&gt;
I started by doing what I do best : Reading! I did a ton of research. I read about individual events, also about lessons from other IM70.3 / Ironman finishers. This helped me understand better on the challenges that lied ahead.  &lt;br /&gt;
During this research, I also consistently came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://trianewlife.com/&quot;&gt;TriANewLife&lt;/a&gt;. TriANewLife offered IM70.3, Full Ironman coaching programs. I sent enquiry on the portal, and their founder/chief coach Deepak Raj reached out to me. I had already researched about Deepak by then, and was very impressed. His profile page captured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Successfully completed 13 IronMan Triathlons (3.8 km swim, 180 km cycling, 42.2 km running) with a best time of 10 hrs 19 min and 08 sec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ranked #31 in world wide rankings for 2014 in IronMan Age Group Rankings (35 to 39 year age group)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Successfully completed 12 Marathons (42.2 km running) with a best time of 2 hrs 59 min and 53 sec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah!! Holy Shit!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepak and I scheduled a call. On phone, I immediately connected to his training philosophy. He took time to understand my current level, my goals, my time commitments. He was quite optimist that I can successfully reach to the level I’m aspiring for.  &lt;br /&gt;
He decided to take me in for online coaching. I was little hesitant on how online coaching would work - I always thought I would have someone working with me in physical proximity. So, reporting progress online sounded unsure. But Deepak’s program had no long term lock-in. Fees was paid every month, with option to stop coaching whenever needed. This was precisely the flexibility I was looking for. I signed up for the program and started this from end July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D was done now, time for execution started. 6 months to go. Event date: &lt;em&gt;19 Feb 2017&lt;/em&gt;. Bye bye sleep. Bye bye parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-philosophy&quot;&gt;Training Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I embark on this training, and during this training journey too, I made some rules for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small and Be Consistent:&lt;/strong&gt; I was 38 when I started this training, and had no steady fitness history. I don’t recall if I did any sport unswervingly for more than few months.  So, it was important for me to keep taking small continuous steps. Consistency, more than excellence, was my focus area. I’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/books/book-review-superhuman-by-habit-by-tynan.html&quot;&gt;so much&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/habits/habit-forming-50-first-dates-report.html&quot;&gt;habit forming&lt;/a&gt;, this was the time to walk the talk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Live to die another day”:&lt;/strong&gt; From the start, my final goal is to Full Ironman, and be long term fit. It was super important to stay injury free. I decided to listen actively to body cues. There were days when office work was very high, family commitments were there. I just focused on continuing baby steps, be flexible in adjusting plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment:&lt;/strong&gt; I started with telling everyone I met, about HIM, and that I was doing it. This level of public commitment ensured I stick to my plan. This strategy worked well, as, in my mind quitting was not even an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swimming&quot;&gt;Swimming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the biggest beast to slay, and naturally my first focus area. In Delhi, swim weather confines from April to Sept. This further reduced my “Swim time window”. I and Anubhav decided to learn swimming at DDA Dwarka sports complex.  We reached out to the pool coach there, and agreed for 2 months of training for 5K INR per person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a personal pool coach was a good, and a much needed idea. Unfortunately, we had many challenges from the start. Firstly, coach was not fixed, was changed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each coach had its own instructing methodology, which often contradicted from other coaches. Our first coach taught “hold the breath, swim, go on as long as you can, capacity will come”. Other coach told us to breathe every stroke. Now, holding breath might work in short distances but for long distances, this will quickly exhaust. Also, all coaches were focused on short distance speed. They were pushing that we do strong and continuous leg movement. Again, good(?) for short distance. I had my Goal clear - Ironman. So, exhausting legs in swim itself was not a smart idea. &lt;br /&gt;
Only worthwhile thing I learnt from the coach was, how to stand in water (called treading the water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at all this, I explored alternatives in parallel. I recalled listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, where he mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://tim.blog/2008/08/13/total-immersion-how-i-learned-to-swim-effortlessly-in-10-days-and-you-can-too/&quot;&gt;“Total Immersion”&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
Total Immersion is a different approach towards swim. Its primary focus is to teach swimmers to move through the water efficiently while staying relaxed in water. Now Geek in me is always obsessed with efficiency. So, when I had read this program in past, it made huge sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-read the book, and started to closely follow TI Vdeo Program (Easy Freestyle) Video program is divided in chapters, designed for self learning one chapter at a time. I went through the videos, and started to practice the drills. Something changed this time - maybe I was committed for IM70.3, maybe I had Anubhav with me to watch and give feedback, maybe I was ready to learn now. I believe it was a mixture of all 3 factors. Finally I moved quickly in swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For last few years, I’ve been striving to achieve some fitness milestone on my b’day. In 2013, I cycled for 75km, in 2014 it was 100km, in 2015 I increased the distance to 200km. So, this year I pushed myself and completed 50mts swim nonstop on my b’day. It felt so awesome!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;
Energized by this achievement, I renewed focus on my fundamentals - hand position, head position, getting comfortable in 7ft pool. From August to Sept, I pursued that. In Sept, I did another leap - moving from 50mts nonstop to doing 1km nonstop. September was a turning point in many a way, right motivation can do wonders. Finally, swimming was enjoyable. I could swim, relax and let my mind wander - all at the same time! Such a nice feeling it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Sept, as Dwarka pool closed, we joined Sirifort pool. 
In November and December, I did few swims there. As the winters progressed it got tougher to deal with climatic conditions in the morning especially as my swim timings were 6am to 7am. &lt;br /&gt;
I used to leave from home at 5:15am, in pitch dark and cold, swim from 6 to 7, go back to home in time to drop Riya to school. It was crazily hectic but swimming was so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jan, I signed up for Talkatora. It has 7ft pool, and it was event venue. I wanted to practice in 7ft pool before the event. This was more of a mental battle - scare factor of swimming in 7ft pool, and no Anubhav to watch my back. For few initial swims, I used to curse myself that why i’m taking such hassles. Mind can be very tricky. Somehow, I knew I had to persist, and eventually it did get easier. Now, I can swim comfortably in deep water. This helped immensely in event day eventually.  &lt;br /&gt;
By now, I was averaging 30min per km, which is not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running&quot;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarka swimming pool closed on 30/Sept. I knew, it was the time to pull up my socks and aim for becoming Forest Gump. Till this time, I had done few runs here and there, but no structured plan. 
To start with, I decided to do Airtel Delhi Half Marathon (ADHM) which was on 20th Nov.  &lt;br /&gt;
The progress was good, as I improved quickly from pace of 8-8.5min/km to 7.5min/km. My max distance quickly increased to 15km. But I started to get knee pain, especially on left knee. It got that bad that I would start getting pain in 3km of run itself. Damn!! &lt;br /&gt;
I was in a state of fix. I understood that i’ve increased my mileage too fast, and my posture was not correct. As time was running out for ADHM, I tried small steps to slow down my running speed, but the pain persisted throughout November. The week preceding ADHM, it was a decision point - to continue, or not to continue with ADHM. I was adamant that I would go ahead and participate. Ain’t pain the ritual through which I’ll become a better runner? But I was adviced (to the point of scolding) that it doesn’t make sense to take chance of permanent injury. So, VERY VERY reluctantly, I withdrew from ADHM. It proved to be right thing to do. “Live to die another day”. &lt;br /&gt;
I paused at this point, and focused on form. Saw many online videos. In particular, advice of “Running Fast and Injury Free” by Gordon Pirie resonated well with me. Like Zen like swimming of TI, Gordon Pirie’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110124045734/http://www.williamsichel.co.uk/documents/Running_Fast_and_Injury_Free.pdf&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; focus much on form and relaxed running. I focused on right posture and correct foot strike. I also changed my shoes, and got Nike Free Air. Form adjustment and right running shoes helped immensely. I went from strength to strength. Knee pain dissipiated when I allowed myself to recover for 10 days. Deepak slowly increased my running mileage.  &lt;br /&gt;
I did my 1st Half Marathon on 1/Jan/2017 in Bali Hills. It took close to 4 hours, including all the breaks. But best part was that there was absolutely no knee pain, and I was kicked to do more. I did another 21.1k distance on 8th Jan, and I was all set for the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cycling&quot;&gt;Cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only reason I could even think of enrolling for IM70.3 was that I had a cycling base. I had been cycling on and off since last year, and could go till 100km easily. In preparation, I did short rides. I did a 200km brevet (30/July) and  300km brevet (10/Sept)
Bought Trek Emoda Road Bike (Road Bike, Race Geometry) a month before the event.  &lt;br /&gt;
Sometime in December, I decided not to go for Delhi Mumbai cycling event. As, I was not completely comfortable with my running, and decided to focus on that. Again, a tough, but I believe a wise decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nutrition&quot;&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continued to proceed on this journey, I realized two things very quickly - clean food is very important, and so is rest. So, I put focus on eating clean as much as I could - avoided fried food, sugar, high carbs. I also focused on sleeping 7-8 hours a day whenever possible. This is often neglected, but again vital part of recovery.  &lt;br /&gt;
Eating clean not only helped me to improve my performance, but had a surprising and welcome impact of shedding weight. I went from 85kg to 77kg, and waist went from 36-37inches to 33 inches! Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-few-weeks&quot;&gt;Final Few Weeks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For last 3 weeks, I trained around Talkatora area, to get myself familiar with route. This proved to be a smart decision (see,consistently smart I’m ;)). Cycling route for my event had lot of inclines, for which I’ve not practiced at all. These 3 weeks gave me time to prepare for that. One week before the event, Anubhav and I did a good fast 10k on that route (1:02hr time, my best 10K so far). This also boosted my confidence level. I collected my event BIB on that day itself from The Bike shop, Green Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here I was. All ground work done, time put in, feeling all ready and anxious for the event. Fingers were crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-08-29T16:21:15+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ne-diaries-number-2-assam</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Dirang, we started our return journey. Wife was keen to contiue till Tawang, but Dirang to Tawang is 175km, and journey takes 8 to 10 hours, as bad roads. We were not keen to do this hectic leg with kids in tow. So, we decided to head back towards Assam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day4--dirang---nameri-national-park&quot;&gt;Day4 : Dirang -&amp;gt; Nameri National Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall pics from Day2, we stopped at Nameri EcoPark for lunch. It was a lovely place, in middle of jungle. So this is where we decided to head back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day5-nameri---kajiranga&quot;&gt;Day5: Nameri -&amp;gt; Kajiranga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day6--kajiranga&quot;&gt;Day6 : Kajiranga&lt;/h2&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All bags packed, we left from Delhi on 7th May. Guwahati was going to be our entry and exit point for this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to spend 6 days in Arunachal Pradesh area, and then come back to Guwahati to meet the parents. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day1--delhi---guwahati&quot;&gt;Day1 : Delhi -&amp;gt; Guwahati&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took IndiGo flight at 10:50AM, and reached Guwahati at 2:50PM (including a halt).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- _includes/image.html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016_05_08/01-2016_05_08-At-Delhi-Airport.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;At Delhi Airport, trip starts&quot; /&gt;  
  &lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;At Delhi Airport, trip starts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was raining when we reached Guwahati. First thing I did on reaching Guwahati airport was to go to Arunachal Pradesh counter. 
Now, Arunachal Pradesh is one of the few places in India for which Inner Line Permit is still needed. This can be applied either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arunachalilp.com/&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, or from few places where ILP on arrival is available. I’ve read on indiamike that one can easily get ILP from Guwahati airport. So, I went there. It was very smooth, the guy on counter was super helpful. For ILP, we needed to provide address proof, id proof and 2 pics. It took us 30” to get ILP for all of us (all except Ryan, as kids below 5 are exempted.  &lt;br /&gt;
We later discovered that kids below 12 are also exempted. But this information was not available on website. So better to have an extra document than less).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Guwahati Airport, we took uber to Paltan Bazar. This is one of the oldest area, and lot of taxi stands are there for outstation taxis. Plan was to take hotel here for the night, and book taxi for early morning. I opened MMT app, and found a hotel (Hotel Ambreesh, Paltan Bazaar). It was nice basic hotel. It costed me 2500/- for a night with breakfast, dinner and extra bed included.&lt;br /&gt;
After settling, I went to the market to search for a taxi guy. Now, Tawang is typically a 5-6 days trip, as distance is long and bad. I’ve heard that roads were not good from Dhirang district. With kids, I didn’t want it to be a strenous trip, where we are stuck in a car on bad roads for 7-8 hours. Our plan was to go as far as we can, and come back. Idea is to enjoy, not to touch the place for the sake of it. Finally, I found a guy who was willing to go with our random plan, as long as I guarantee to hire him for 5 days atleast. He had a brand new innova. So, we finalized the deal (4500/- per day charges)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day2-guwahati---bhalukpong&quot;&gt;Day2: Guwahati -&amp;gt; Bhalukpong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Day1, our target was to reach at Bhalukpong, which is end point of Assam. We started around 8AM from hotel. All excited, trip was starting now. Some pics from Day2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch, we stopped at a place called Nameri Fishing Camp. This was a beautiful place, in middle of jungle. Unfortunately, food was finished there! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 4PM, we reached Bhalukpong. We took cottage at Prashanti Lodge (Rs 1700/- for cottage)

&lt;p&gt;TBD
After having a nice breakfast at the lodge, we left for Dirang. The roads starts to go little bad from Bhalukpong, and it was expected to take about 4-5 hours to reach. 
Bhalukpong is one of the entry point for Arunachal Pradesh. So we had to show our ILP here. &lt;br /&gt;
Weather was very nice today, and scenery even more so.  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a “famous” hot water spring in Dirang. We climbed down there. What a disappointment it was. Having seen hot water geysers in Ladakh, we were expecting something similar. But water was not even lukewarm. Some locals were bathing in there, and it all looked very unhygenic. Surely a waste of time.

   <title>North East Trip - Planning</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/travel/netrip/north-east-trip-planning.html"/>
   <updated>2016-07-16T11:30:21+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/travel/netrip/north-east-trip-planning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wife: “Kitni thand hogi? Jackets ok ya sweater lun?” &lt;br /&gt;
Riya: “Swimming pool to hoga na?” &lt;br /&gt;
Ryan: “Hum hotel jaa rahe hein?” &lt;br /&gt;
Me (wondering): “This river rafting at Bharamputra seems very cool. Need to check” &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip planning is a serious business. Biggest question usually is where to go. Actually, no! Biggest question is chutti kitni hai? How many days of vacation can we take? Ok for both of us? Ok for Kids? Ok for parents, who were joining us this time? So, aligning dates, and then the right place to go (as per weather) is the first question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this trip, atleast we had an initial plan - Cherrapunji! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had one week to spare before our parents joined us. We initially explored going to Bhutan for a week from Guwahati but dropped the plan for 2 reasons: 1) Delhi-Bhutan airfare is almost same as Guwahati-Bhutan. So didn’t make sense. and 2) The flight to Bhutan was sold out for our dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wife and I took out NE Map, started exploring areas. We also looked into 8 days package from popular travel companies - Makemytrip, Cleartrip etc, to get an idea of what are the popular sightseeing options. Now we generally don’t do all “touristy” stuff, but it is a good area to start investigation from. And ofcourse, tripadvisor and indiamike.com are my fav sites to explore in detail. &lt;br /&gt;
One remark here - since past many years, we always make only high level tentative plans, and never booked a package tour. This gives us a lot of flexibility when we reach the place - some new places to discover. This was to happen in this trip too - we could discover Majuli River Island, and Maple Pine Farm only because we had a flexibility. Ofcourse, this way is not for everyone. But if you can travel like this, it is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, back from digressing. Trip dates were settled, tentative list of places was settled. We were going to go to Tawang in Arunachal, and then join parents on 12th May at Guwahati, to go to Meghalaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went over what all to take, what would be the weather, how we’ll commute (luggage depends on that). Discussion and planning went on till 7th Morning, which was our journey start date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a trip it was going to be!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Year: 1990&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Geography Teacher to class: “Name the place which gets max rainfall in a year” &lt;br /&gt;
We all shouting, trying to impress the teacher: “Cherrapunji!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with Cherrapunji.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other kids, I first read about Cherrapunji during school time. Our education system is famous for making us remember countless useless trivia. This was one of them. But somehow name of this place stayed with me.
My entire childhood  was in Delhi, where summers are merciless. Monsoon season is the time when whole earth smiles, flowers bloom, sun takes a rest and it is pleasant all around. As far as I remember, I’ve always been in love with rains. No wonder I could not forget about the place where it rains the most! Cherrapunji!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few years back, I read a novel - “Twilight” and saw the movie series. Now, in this movie, hero is a vampire, who can’t be out in the sun (Vampires, you see! They don’t have very sunny disposition). So he has to always stay where very less sun, and it rains. Whole novel was set in Forks, Washington where it rains a lot. Now, novel was forgettable, movie even more so. But visuals of lush green all around with rain pouring in were awesome. Bought back my thoughts about Cherrapunji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months back, I read an article on indiamike about living root bridge trek in Meghalaya. And where is this living root bridge? Cherrapunji! I was sold, had to visit this place now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whole north east trip planning started with Cherrapunji as “must-visit”. Rest were all afterthought places. And I was in for some surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In following articles, I’m going to capture the journey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 1: Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 2: Journey Starts - Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 3: Assam - Land of Rhinos and Bharamputra&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 4: Meghalaya - Abode of Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immensely practical book on how habits are formed (both good and bad), how we fail to stick to build good habits. The book covers both psychological aspects, and give lot of practical tips on how to build a sustaining habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-notes&quot;&gt;My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building habits makes so much of life automatic that it feels like having complete autonomy because one don’t have to worry about the basics. They get done in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a habit, and why are habits so important? It’s an action that you take on a repeated basis with little or no required effort or thought. The power of a habit lies in the second part of that definition–the bit about no required effort or thought. It’s a loophole that allows you to upgrade your health, quality of life, productivity, and enjoyment of the world with a fixed expenditure of energy in creating a habit, rather than on an ongoing drain on your willpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit is what we have closest to superpower.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Spend Your Willpower, Invest It&lt;/strong&gt; The glorious benefit of a habit is that it converts something that requires a lot of willpower and focus into something that becomes automatic and often outside of our conscious thought. We can consciously push ourselves to do a only a certain amount of things every day, which means that if we don’t have good habits, there is an ceiling to what we can accomplish, personally and a professionally. This limit is not particularly high, and is probably not high enough to achieve our goals and live the life we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This takes effort, but establishing most habits takes the relatively short time of one to twelve months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to improve yourself permanently, you must develop more old habits, which is done by creating new habits and sticking with them until they mature into old habits. You know that a habit has crossed that threshold when it becomes something that you subconsciously do, rather than something you must consciously think about doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking through a long-term lens, we can easily see that consistency is the most important factor. Just as it would be better to make 5% interest per year on your financial investments for the rest of your life than 50% interest for one year, it’s better to maintain a modest life-long habit than to start an extreme habit that can’t be sustained for a single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your results will be commensurate with the consistency to which you execute your habits, not to the magnitude of their one-time impact. The practical implications of this are twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, be conservative when sizing your new habits. Instead of saying that you will eat a perfect diet for the rest of your life, resolve to cut sugar down by fifty percent. Rather than saying that you will run every single day, agree to jog home from the train station every day instead of walk, and do one long run every week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, you should be very scared to fail to execute a habit, even once.&lt;/strong&gt; By failing to execute, potentially you’re not just losing a minor bit of progress, but rather threatening the cumulative benefits you’d accrue  by establishing a habit. This is a huge deal and should not be treated lightly. So make your habits relatively easy, but never miss doing them.**&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing two days of a habit is habit suicide.&lt;/strong&gt; If missing one day reduces your chances of long-term success by a small amount like five percent, missing two days reduces it by forty percent or so. Three days missed and you may as well be starting over. At that point you have lost your momentum and have made it far too easy for you to skip in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning a variance, make it concrete, black and white, and specify exactly when the variance will end. For example, instead of doing your regular gym routine while traveling through Europe, you commit to do twenty pushups every morning, and then as soon as you return home, resume your normal routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Just Go . Do a Terrible Job&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember that the power of a habit isn’t actually in the individual execution, but in the consistency. &lt;strong&gt;It is far far worse to skip doing something than to just do a horrible job of it.&lt;/strong&gt; This feels wrong and sounds counterintuitive, but it’s true. Skipping a day makes you feel guilty and unmotivated to do it the next day. Doing a crappy job makes you feel a little bit guilty, but also proud that you worked through a tough time, and eager to improve the next time. Don’t believe me? Try it out for yourself. Don’t Reward the Lazy Brain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever you stick to a habit, especially if it was difficult or you did particularly well, take two seconds, smile, and congratulate yourself. A fist pump coupled with a, .Yes!. might be in order.&lt;/strong&gt; It feels silly and trite, but it serves its purpose of releasing endorphins and marking progress. It’s a reminder to yourself that you’re working on something worthwhile and succeeding at it. With the difficulty of building habits and the inevitable slip-ups, these simple rewards can be the difference between enjoying habit change and dreading it to the point of failure. Small actions like rewarding yourself with a moment of congratulations combine to build a personal system of habit building. Just as any given instance of executing a habit is insignificant compared to the cumulative benefit, every small piece of your habit-building system combines to create a powerful method of improving yourself.
Focusing on results, especially short term results, is an excellent way to add stress to your life, which is an excellent way to quit a habit associated with that stress, thus ensuring no long term results are ever achieved. &lt;strong&gt;Track your adherence to process, not your results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addition Versus Subtraction&lt;/strong&gt;   Fundamentally, there seem to be two types of people: those who find it easier to add new things to do, and those who find it easier to subtract things. A simple test is to think about whether it’s easier for you to cut out junk food or to go to the gym. Those who prefer to go to the gym are adders, and those who cut out junk food are subtracters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overshoot&lt;/strong&gt;  Habit forming is effective and efficient, but it’s not effortless. Habits should always follow an actual concrete goal, rather than just exist for the sake of having a habit. In other words, don’t eat healthily because it sounds like a nice habit, eat that way because you want to live longer, be more capable of physical activity, or improve your appearance. An important component of having a goal tied to a habit is that it allows you to size your habit proportionally to the goal. If you want to lose weight to look better, maybe you need to lose one pound per month for a year. That will allow you to create an easily sustainable habit that will get you to your goal and still leave you plenty of capacity for other habits or obligations on your time and willpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are not going to follow through with a habit, it is better to never start it at all.&lt;/strong&gt;  A downward spiral of failing to adopt habits is harmful in the long term, and the time spent on a habit that never had a chance could have been better spent on a properly motivated habit that would have been successful. Whenever you feel like you may not have proper motivation for a habit, pick a new one and revisit the discarded habit later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;   Sometimes you have to create a new habit due to outside pressures, but you don’t have a burning desire to implement it. Chances of success under these conditions is slim, so you must learn to discover motivation. On a piece of paper, write down these four sections: 1. What good things will happen if I implement this habit? 2. What bad things will happen if I implement this habit? 3. What good things will happen if I don’t implement this habit? 4. What bad things will happen if I don’t implement this habit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Easy and Often&lt;/strong&gt; : You’ll get the greatest compliance by maximizing frequency and minimizing intensity. Daily habits are hard to overlook or miss, and low intensity habits are easy to complete. This combination greatly increases your chances of sticking with a habit. Start small, become consistent, and increase at a manageable pace. That’s how you optimize for the finish line, rather than the starting line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Magic of Daily Habits&lt;/strong&gt;:   Whether for small or big habits, bias yourself strongly towards habits which require daily execution. There are several factors in play that counter-intuitively make daily habits the easiest to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The daily habit also earns a place in the front of your consciousness. It’s hard to juggle complex weekly and irregular schedules, but we all know the basic things we must do each day. It takes a couple weeks of compliance, but it’s daily habits will quickly become an indelible part of your daily must-do list. I’ve written every day for the past six months or so, so if I didn’t write today, something would feel wrong, just as if I forgot to brush my teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Build Habits That can be Automated&lt;/strong&gt;. Prime candidates for automation tend to be these sorts of habits, those that are less about personal change and more about things that just .have to be done. on a regular basis. Saving a minute or two here and there isn’t a big deal, but the cumulative benefit of removing things from that mental todo list is big. It’s the difference between constant distraction, wondering if there’s something critical that needs to be done, and having a clear mind for whatever tasks and habits you have each day. An example would be automating your credit card payments so that cards automatically get paid in full on their due dates. As long as you’re confident you’ll always have enough money in your account, that’s a decent sized mental burden you can completely erase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loading-and-maintenance&quot;&gt;Loading and Maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are creatures of routine, and altering that routine takes significantly more willpower and effort than simply maintaining it. For that reason, you’ll often want to have one very strict habit for loading, and then another to maintain. Put in the effort up front and then make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know when to switch from your loading habit to your maintenance habit? The key is to be able to honestly evaluate what would happen if you dropped the habit entirely. If you think that you would immediately go back to your old ways, keep loading. If you think that you would either slowly slide back to your old ways over a period of months or years, or if you think you’d remain in stasis, switch to a maintenance habit. The purpose of the loading habit is to completely remove all associations with your old habit. You start small, build up to your loading habit, keep at it until you believe that your new behavior is fixed in place, and then switch to maintenance.
The hidden benefit is that you can only have one action most-strongly linked to any given trigger, so this is also a good way to get rid of bad habits. If you have the habit of browsing gossip sites whenever you turn on your computer, and you retrain yourself to respond to open emails as soon as you turn on the computer, you both gain a new good habit and lose a bad old one.
When appropriate, sacrifice your maintenance habits in favor of keeping up your loading habits. You might let your diet slip, because you’ve been on it for years, but make a point of writing five-hundred words every day because that’s a new habit that hasn’t gotten a toehold yet. Maintenance habits will very quickly slip back into place on the chain when you’re able to return to it, but I’ve found loading habits to feel like big impositions and sometimes completely fall off. The solution is to only quit habits when you no longer want to quit them. This is the only mindset under which we can make difficult decisions and not be influenced by our pesky lazy brain. This point will never be found in the loading period, only some time during the maintenance period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Chaining Habits 
You can also use habits as triggers for other habits, thus creating a reliable chain. For example, when I wake up, the very first thing I do is put a pot of water on the stove. Putting the water on is a trigger to brush my teeth, so I do that while it boils. Once it’s done, I make tea and sit down at my desk. That’s a trigger for me to read my email, check my calendar, and check various reports and stats that may affect how I plan my day. When I’m done with all that, I allow myself to browse my favorite sites, but finishing my tea is a trigger to get to work. If I feel tired while I work, that’s a trigger to drink some water, a trigger I reprogrammed from my previous default of lying on my bed and possibly taking a nap. My entire day isn’t one giant long chain, but there are some core sequences. Waking up is one and the clock hitting midnight (signaling the end of my workday) is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-natural-habitat-of-a-habit-builder&quot;&gt;The Natural Habitat of A Habit Builder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most activities, there is an ideal environment in which they take place. A weightlifter can get a decent workout in using his own bodyweight and items he finds around him, but to maximize his gains, he’ll want to be in a well-equipped gym. A chef can whip up a good meal with leftovers over a single burner, but a stocked kitchen will allow him to cook better food in the same amount of time. There is also an ideal habitat for a habit builder, but it relies less on physical tools and more on environment. This doesn’t mean that building the ideal environment is any less important for the habit builder. Given the same level of willpower and motivation, having the right environment decreases slip-ups and reduces the stress of building habits. 
** Simplicity and freedom from distraction are the core components of the habit builder’s habitat.** Building habits takes conscious focus, and to focus you must eliminate distractions. In particular, you want to eliminate the type of distractions that force you to use willpower. For example, watching advertisements might prompt you to weigh the pros and cons of buying something you don’t really need. That mental battle, subconscious though it may be, reduces the willpower you have available for your habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of your focus should be directly on the habits you’re trying to build. There’s no better angle to hit a nail than head-on. Be aware of your environment, though, and make changes to improve it. Short term efforts to improve your environment can pay off big in the long term by making new habits easier and faster to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;practical-analysis-of-various-habits&quot;&gt;PRACTICAL ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS HABITS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;positivity-habits&quot;&gt;Positivity Habits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming positive is a one-habit job that takes one to three months. You will notice a difference after one month, but it will have built so gradually that you may discount it’s effectiveness. This is similar to having laser eye surgery, where after a couple months you can’t remember having bad vision, and the wonder of perfect eyesight no longer seems so amazing. From now on, every time you have any negative thought, simply think of one positive aspect of the situation. The positive aspect doesn’t have to be equal in magnitude to the negative aspects, it just has to exist.
At first this process will feel cumbersome and unwieldy, which will discourage you from continuing with the habit. Remember that if you’ve committed to this habit, you should not quit in the loading phase where there are no benefits but there is effort required. After a period of two to four weeks, the habit will become almost automatic. Remain vigilant and make sure that you’re still doing it. After two or three months you will have trained your brain to automatically come up with the positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health-habits&quot;&gt;Health Habits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health habits are some of my favorites to work on because they have extraordinarily high payoffs. Rather than improve just one area of your life, they tend to really transfer well to other areas. Unless you already have an excellent repertoire of health habits, I’d encourage you to start with a health habit or two.
Because limiting processed carbohydrates is so important, I would focus on it exclusively rather than trying to do oils and fats at the same time. Success for that first habit is critical enough to warrant eating unhealthy oils in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-sleep&quot;&gt;Good Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step towards a good sleep habit is creating a good sleep environment. The key components of a good sleep environment are complete darkness and silence. Buy a sleep mask. Bucky 40 Blinks mask. Wear the mask every single night, even though you will just pull it off in your sleep for the first few weeks. Regulate your bedtime. Set a strict screens-off time one or two hours prior to your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meditation&quot;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your overriding goal is just to sit there for five minutes. Any time you do that, you have successfully meditated. When you notice that your mind starts thinking about something else, refocus on your breathe. The loading period for meditating is approximately two months. After that you continue to meditate every single day, but you will slowly begin to see the benefits, which makes it much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-daily&quot;&gt;Writing Daily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began writing my blog nine years ago, completely on a lark and without any expectations for it. Since then it’s become a major avenue of connecting with other people, and has become a primary source of income , but the biggest benefit is that it has made me a clearer and more precise thinker and communicator. For that reason, I recommend that you build the habit of writing daily as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-easy-habit-to-stay-on-top-of-email&quot;&gt;The Easy Habit to Stay On Top of Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you read any email that requires further action, including replying, following up, visiting a web site, etc., you flag or star it. Once per day, preferably early afternoon when you’ve had the chance to read emails and still have a bunch of productive time left, go through all of the starred emails and either reply, take the necessary action, or unstar it. Notes: You can also reply to email immediately. Even if you’re going to do this, star it first. This gets you into the habit of deciding up front if email is going to be acted on or not, which is the important part. The nice thing about this habit is that because the deciding is decoupled from the acting, there’s never a good reason not to star. Then, even if you’ve skipped the writing phase for a few days, say while traveling, you can pick back up with all of your starred emails as soon as you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twice-then-quit&quot;&gt;Twice, Then Quit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice, then Quit is very simple. When you want to quit working for the first time, don’t. Push through and work some more. The second time you want to quit, also don’t quit. Push through again. The third time you want to quit, go ahead and quit. This habit is deceptively simple, but is very effective. It allows us to push through while simultaneously taking pressure off because we know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel and that we won’t drive ourselves to complete exhaustion. It also allows us to quit when we are really exhausted, rather than when we hit a small stumbling block. Often I’ll feel exhausted because the work ahead of me seems daunting, but once I push through for the first time I get through a tough bit, and then feel like working again. So even when you don’t actually push twice, but then quit, you’ll benefit from the habit. Last, when you finally do quit, you can enjoy your time or spend it working on something else, rather than feeling like you should have kept working. This is important, because we want to maximize all of the use of our time, not just the time we spend producing. When you push through twice but still want to quit, you can be confident that you gave it a solid effort and that you need a little bit of time off before tackling the problem again. That lack of ambiguity erases unnecessary guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rating-your-day&quot;&gt;Rating Your Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night, before you go to bed, rate your day on a scale from one to ten. I recommend that you rate yourself on how little time you wasted, rather than on raw productivity or output. This method has its perils, but the advantage is that you don’t have to give yourself a bad rating if you spent the day doing something unproductive but worthwhile, like helping out a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it All Together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, though, the practice of building habits is simple. We identify things that we do each day and we adjust them to make them a little bit better. We put our faith in the compounded power of small repeated actions, and we adjust our behavior to reap those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Habit Forming - 50 First dates - Report</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/habits/habit-forming-50-first-dates-report.html"/>
   <updated>2016-03-09T20:53:49+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/habits/habit-forming-50-first-dates-report</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I captured in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jigyasu.com/blog/2016/02/18/habits/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I started the habit drive on 19th Jan 2016. Now it is 50 days since I started, and this is my first report.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;habit---daily-exercise&quot;&gt;Habit - Daily Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance to Rule #1, I picked “7 Minute Workout” to be performed every day. This is a collection of 12 exercises, covering entire body. Each exercise lasts for 30 seconds,  10 seconds break between 2 exercises (which makes it total of almost 8 minutes, not 7 min as the exercise name suggests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise and the science behind it is covered by an excellant New York Times Article &lt;a href=&quot;http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I downloaded the &lt;del&gt;free&lt;/del&gt; app provided by New York Times Group itself (iTunes link &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/7-minute-workout-challenge/id680170305?mt=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) (Apparently it used to be free when I bought it, now it is $2.99. Other free variants available on iTunes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trigger&quot;&gt;Trigger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Morning, after brushing the teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;report-of-first-50-days&quot;&gt;Report of First 50 days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was completely consistent, did exercise every single day. Some days were easy, some were tough. But as I’ve made plans for this (Rule#3), importance was given to consistency. And on many days, I felt I couldn’t do it. But once I started, I was able to complete most of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-went-right&quot;&gt;What went right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was only 7 minutes, so easy to do.
-“7 MWC” app provides visual guidance on how to perform the exercise, which was helpful in initial days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also, “7 MWC” has a nice calendar in it. Once I complete exercise, it automatically marks that day in the calendar. This helps me to track, and keeps up the daily chain (to understand the concept of daily chain, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by world famous comedian Jerry Seinfield)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had planned to be consistent every single day. This has helped me, I didn’t have to wonder if today is the day I’m supposed to exercise or not. With this journey, I’m realizing it is more of mental game than physical game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-be-changedimproved&quot;&gt;What to be changed/improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing yet. I’ll continue to follow 7MWC for another 40 days, and will decide after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already feeling better with fitness. Exercise is getting easier. There is also an interesting impact - as I complete this first thing in the morning, there is a sense of accomplishment, and day starts on a positive note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;habit---meditation&quot;&gt;Habit - Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-1&quot;&gt;What to do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded an app called “Headspace”. It is a subscription based app, with 10 days of free guided meditation. Each session is 10 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trigger-1&quot;&gt;Trigger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Morning, after exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;report-of-first-month&quot;&gt;Report of First Month&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did it regularly for first 10 days. After that, I was undecided whether to a) Find another free app, b) Use this app free sessions again, or c) Go for paid subscription. In the end, I did a mix of a) and b) and ended up being inconsistent. From last 45 days, I would have meditated approx 25 days. &lt;strong&gt;Fail from habit forming aspect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-went-right-1&quot;&gt;What went right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Headspace app is good guided app. Helped me in initial 10 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-learnt&quot;&gt;Lesson Learnt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started ambitious. My mornings are packed, and sparing 10 minutes for meditation AFTER 7 minutes of workout was very challenging. I should have started with lesser duration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of planning of timing for meditation. Meditation is different from exercise. In exercise, I can do it surrounded by people. In meditation, I need to be alone. So, order of trigger was also not good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of planning for app to use. I stated with Headspace, then moved to Calm, and now to “Insight Timer”. By moving around apps, I couldn’t have a central place where I can track my progress. The daily chain concept, which helped me in exercise was missing from here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop days: Due to previous points, I struggled to keep the routine, and had few days where I forgot meditation. As Tynan notes in his book “Superhuman by Habits”,
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;*Missing two days of a habit is habit suicide. If missing one day reduces your chances of long-term success by a small amount like five percent, missing two days reduces it by forty percent or so. Three days missed and you may as well be starting over. At that point you have lost your momentum and have made it far too easy for you to skip in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-be-changedimproved-1&quot;&gt;What to be changed/improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt;  Trigger to be changed. I’ll now meditate as soon as I get up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App:&lt;/strong&gt; Going to use “Stop Breathe and Think”. It is a simple app, where one can do un-guided time based meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Will do for 3 minutes for one month. Start small, be consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Habits</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/habits/habits.html"/>
   <updated>2016-02-19T06:19:45+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/habits/habits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The year was 2014. It was onset of winters, and I was in a charter bus, on my way to our team outbound program, to a nearby hillstation called “Kasauli”. Tucked in my woolens from head to toe, I vividly recall reading a book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.in/The-Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Matters/dp/1583335080&quot;&gt;“The Willpower Instinct”&lt;/a&gt;. I would not be so dramatic to say that this book changed my life, but it definitely gave me a powerful insight, which has stayed with me since then.
In over-simplified view, this book says that willpower is a limited resource, and trusting willpower to bring long term changes is not a smart strategy.  This is true for almost all aspects of our life - be it be one trying to exercise regularly, or eat well, or avoid procrastination at work etc etc. This is the reason why so many New Year Resolution do not last, and people make short term changes, only to go back to old habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve experimented on and off to find the right approach for self-improvement. What I’ve learnt is actually very simple - “We are what we do”. Key is to form the right habits, take very small but regular steps, and minimize use of willpower.
This is not a new idea. Infact Stanford professor BJ Foggs, who is a proponent of building tiny habits, has refined this idea to an algorithm . Anyone can join his habit forming workshop (all online, for one week duration, takes total 30 min of your time in one week, all free) here: &lt;a href=&quot;www.tinyhabits.com&quot;&gt;Tiny Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, biggest clarity on how to approach habit forming came after reading the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.in/Superhuman-Habit-Becoming-Possible-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00NGC8I9E&quot;&gt;“Superhuman by Habits”&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very practical book, gives tons of insight on how to go about building habits, what challenges one can expect, and how to manage those challenges. I’ve never read more clear manual on habit forming. It is a very engaging book, and Author (Tynan) is a very famous blogger, who has actually gone through the grind and done all this by himself. So, reading the book is gaining his hard won knowledge, in a very good summary. If you’ve to pick one book for habit forming, I strongly recommend his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this, I’ve decided to start working on building new habits, and capture my journey online here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rules-ive-implemented&quot;&gt;The rules I’ve implemented&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Small, make it tiny. A good tiny behavior is easy to do and fast. It should not take more than 10 min max. We often start big, driven by our willpower. It is just that willpower doesn’t last for long, and we come crashing down after initial excitement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Well defined trigger. Find a spot in your existing routine, where this tiny new behavior could fit. Put it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; some act which is a solid habit.  Eg, 2 pushups to be done daily as soon as you finish brushing your teeth, or two min walk after lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus more on consistency than excellance. In short term, idea is to build a routine, and daily small gains are better than once in a while perfect execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked two habits to start with : Exercise and Meditation. Exercise for Physical Well Being, and Meditation for being mindful,  more calm and focus. I believe both these habits will help me be better personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep capturing my journey notes here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building a website - #1 - Registering a Domain</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/building-a-website-number-1-registering-a-domain.html"/>
   <updated>2014-08-30T06:10:35+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/building-a-website-number-1-registering-a-domain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this series of articles, I’m going to capture step by step process involved in setting up a website.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article focus on registering the domain name for the website.This the name you want to give to your website. Registering the domain doesn’t give you a website, it just gives you a name. It is similar to registering a new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main steps to follow to register the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we register the domain, we’ve to finalize which domain name to register. Choosing name for your website is something which varies from person to person, on the need. But be aware that nowadays, most of the good/common names are taken. To find a good name for your website, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leandomainsearch.com/&quot; title=&quot;Lean Domain Search&quot;&gt;LeanDomainSearch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve finalized a domain name which is available, it must be registered. ICANN is the organization which registers all the website names. The domain can be registered on ICANN via a a Domain Name Registerar.
Two of the most famous options are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com&quot; title=&quot;GoDaddy&quot;&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namescheap.com&quot; title=&quot;NamesCheap&quot;&gt;Namescheap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is registered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com&quot; title=&quot;GoDaddy&quot;&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve a very clean interface and easy to use.
Nowadays, you can register the website for one year at cost of $10. No reason not to grab the domain name of your choice now.&lt;/p&gt;
